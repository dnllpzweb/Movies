Don't bleed to death.

57
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,051
- Hello, Mitchell.
- Bond.

58
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,679
The Americans are gonna be
none too pleased about this.

59
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,723
I promised them Le Chiffre,
and they got Le Chiffre.

60
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,265
They got his body.

61
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,594
If they'd wanted his soul, they should

62
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:58,436
have made a deal with a priest.

63
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,855
- Has he said anything?
- No.

64
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,817
I'm going to check the perimeter, ma'am.

65
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,486
You look like hell.

66
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,905
When's the last time you slept?

67
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,825
Vesper's boyfriend, Yusef Kabira,

68
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,652
the one who was abducted in Morocco,

69
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:15,162
the one she was trying to save.

70
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,580
His body was washed up
on a beach in Ibiza.

71
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,333
We're meant to believe the
fish did that to his face.

72
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,210
His wallet and ID were in his pocket.

73
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,004
- Well, that's convenient.
- Quite.

74
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,193
Which is why I did a DNA check on a lock

75
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:28,299
of his hair found in Vesper's apartment.

76
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,467
It's not him.

77
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,219
A lock of his hair?

78
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,097
I wouldn't have thought
Vesper the sentimental type.

79
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,808
Well, we never really know anyone, do we?

80
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,645
But I do need to know, Bond.

81
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,606
I need to know that I can trust you.

82
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
And you don't?

83
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,027
Well, it'd be a pretty cold bastard

84
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,988
who didn't want revenge for the
death of someone he loved.

85
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,157
You don't have to worry about me.

86
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,493
I'm not gonna go chasing
him. He's not important.

87
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,497
And neither was she.

88
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,791
It's clear, ma'am.

89
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,169
- Thanks, Mitchell.
- Shall we?

90
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,982
Are you gonna tell us who you work for?

91
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,235
I was always very interested to meet you.

92
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,738
I'd heard so much about you from Vesper.

93
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,908
The real shame is that if
she hadn't killed herself,

94
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,910
we would have had you, too.

95
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,371
I think you would have
done anything for her.

96
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,142
Well, you know you're not in Britain,

97
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,917
and God knows where you'll be tomorrow.

98
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,419
Which should tell you that eventually

99
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,671
you will tell us about the
people you work with,

100
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,342
and the longer it takes, the
more painful we'll make it.

101
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,555
You really don't know anything about us.

102
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,146
It's so amusing because we are
on the other side, thinking,

103
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,941
"The MI6, the CIA, they're
looking over our shoulders.

104
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,818
"They're listening to
our conversations."

105
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,071
And the truth is you don't
even know we exist.

106
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,616
Well, we do now, Mr White,
and we're quick learners.

107
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,661
Oh, really?

108
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,956
Well, then, the first thing
you should know about us

109
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,542
is that we have people everywhere.

110
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,752
Am I right?

111
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,693
Anything?

112
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,196
Craig Mitchell worked
for me for eight years.

113
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,741
He passed a full security check
and lie detector test every year.

114
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,453
Didn't leave so much as a scrap
of paper to explain any of it.

115
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,497
Eight years. Five as
my personal bodyguard.

116
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,917
I found this and three other
bloody Christmas presents

117
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,210
I bought him about the house.

118
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,794
I don't think he smoked.

119
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,796
And you had to kill him.

120
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,527
Couldn't bring him in for questioning so

121
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:07,133
that we might actually learn something.

122
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,076
When someone says we
got people everywhere,

123
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:10,387
you expect it to be hyperbole.

124
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,473
Lots of people say that.
Florists use that expression.

125
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,427
Doesn't mean that they've got somebody

126
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:17,394
working for them inside the bloody room.

127
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,687
What the hell is this organisation, Bond?

128
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,399
How can they be everywhere and
we know nothing about them?

129
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,363
I assume we found no trace of White.

130
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:27,364
No.

131
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,821
The agent guarding the door in the garage

132
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,740
was dead before you
passed him on the stairs.

133
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,617
I passed him on the
stairs? Christ.

134
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,078
Mitchell must have killed him when

135
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,578
he went out to check the perimeter.

136
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,371
You're lucky to be here.

137
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,998
Do you think White's still alive?

138
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,875
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

139
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,835
Craig Mitchell, 45 years old.

140
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,338
No living family. Gave
generously to charity.

141
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,173
Tell me you know more than that.

142
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,643
Our moneymen went through every bill

143
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:49,843
in Mitchell's wallet and house.

144
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,970
- How much did he have?
- Less than 100 pounds,

145
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,014
and about the same in euros and dollars.

146
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,599
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.

147
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,309
We've done a complete forensic analysis

148
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,978
of every note and its traceable history.

149
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,771
Not in the mood.

150
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,857
After you.

151
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,886
This particular note from Mitchell's

152
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:07,887
wallet may be of interest.

153
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:08,889
Scanning.

154
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,235
We introduced tagged bills into Le

155
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:11,865
Chiffre's money-laundering operation

156
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,116
by intercepting illegal pay-offs.

157
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,638
We traced money through several of

158
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:17,203
his bank accounts around the world.

159
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,538
That's pretty thin.

160
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,831
At the rate money changes hands,

161
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,041
you could probably find a
tenner in my wallet with a tag.

162
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,210
That's true, ma'am. A single
bill could be a coincidence,

163
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,045
but what about a whole stack?

164
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,381
These bills, from the same
series as Mitchell's,

165
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,467
were just scanned at a bank
in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,

166
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,470
deposited in the account of a Mr Slate.

167
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,138
Impress me.

168
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,308
We have a Mr Edmund Slate
returning to Port-au-Prince

169
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,518
from Heathrow this morning.

170
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,355
His entry documents have him
staying at the Hotel Dessalines.

171
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,315
He's in room 325.

172
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,994
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

173
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,624
Do you have any messages for 325?

174
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,962
No, sir. The only message
was about the briefcase

175
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,547
that was delivered earlier.

176
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,260
Did you want us to continue holding it?

177
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:17,425
No. No, I'll take that now.

178
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,843
Yes, sir.

179
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,848
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

180
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,691
Get in.

181
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,943
- What?
- Get in.

182
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,989
All right.

183
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,702
You're late.

184
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,829
I got pulled into a meeting.

185
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,330
Who with?

186
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,499
A friend of Mr White's.

187
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,377
Don't think I know him.

188
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,257
It's funny.

189
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,342
You don't look at all like I expected.

190
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,595
Really? What were you expecting?

191
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,181
I didn't think geologists looked so...

192
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,432
So?

193
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,729
A friend of yours?

194
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,856
I don't have any friends.

195
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,157
Get out of the way. Move.

196
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,962
We didn't settle on a price.

197
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,714
Make me an offer.

198
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,468
We can work it out later, over drinks.

199
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,724
Dominic didn't give you
any trouble, did he?

200
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,058
No.

201
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,439
What the hell is this?

202
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,025
I think someone wants to kill you.

203
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,116
That wasn't very nice.

204
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,414
- You were supposed to shoot her.
- Well, I missed.

205
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,468
Get Bond.

206
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,834
Where is he now?

207
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:29,098
Approaching the docks, Kings Quay.

208
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,061
- Connecting.
- Tanner.

209
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,187
I've got Bond.

210
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,438
Ask him about Slate.

211
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,148
She wants to know about Slate.

212
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,817
Tell her Slate was a dead end.

213
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,985
Slate was a dead end.

214
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,319
Connection terminated.

215
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,113
Damn him. He killed him.

216
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,528
Let her through.

217
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,904
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

218
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,148
Touch me and I'll break your wrist.

219
00:23:22,562 --> 00:23:24,919
- We have a visitor.
- Not now, I'm busy.

220
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,785
Camille.

221
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,663
How nice to see you.

222
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,874
Alive, you mean?

223
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,211
I knew we shouldn't have slept together.

224
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,714
I think I'm starting to like you.

225
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,592
So you did just try and have me killed.

226
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,472
And that made me very sad thinking
I would never see you again.

227
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,141
But here you are.

228
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,102
Damn it, Dominic. I was
trying to help you.

229
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,025
I was trying to uncover a leak.

230
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,277
And you, you sent someone to kill me?

231
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,238
Please don't talk to me like I'm stupid.

232
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,533
It's unattractive.

233
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,622
Come. I wanna show you something.

234
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,875
Come.

235
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,628
There's nothing that makes
me more uncomfortable

236
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,130
than friends talking behind my back.

237
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,882
It feels like

238
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,677
ants under my skin.

239
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,097
It's been that way forever.

240
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,224
I remember when I was 15,

241
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,353
I had a crush on one of my
mother's piano students.

242
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:44,733
Somehow I overheard her saying
very nasty things about me.

243
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,736
I got so angry.

244
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,698
I took an iron.

245
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,536
Is that him?

246
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,872
I... We only spoke on the phone.

247
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,129
It's such a shame because he's
one of my best geologists.

248
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,549
He said you asked to buy information.

249
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,970
No. He called me and offered
to sell me information.

250
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,975
Why would I come back here if I was lying?

251
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,185
Because you love me.

252
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,438
I was doing it for you.

253
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,940
To stop him from betraying you.

254
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,070
You know what burns more
than all your bullshit?

255
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,510
Is that I always got the feeling

256
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:34,366
that you were only sleeping with me

257
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,618
to get to General Medrano.

258
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,289
Is that him?

259
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,209
You know how these deposed dictators are,

260
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,336
jealous of their safety.

261
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,882
Stick around.

262
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,468
I'll introduce you.

263
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,055
Do you see the girl that
just walked in here?

264
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,266
Could you give her that?
Tell her to call me.

265
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,466
What did he want?

266
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:06,610
He wants her to call him.

267
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,997
You've reached Universal Exports.
Our offices are currently closed.

268
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:25,600
Pay attention next time.

269
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,132
And you can do all this for me?

270
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,095
Well, look at what we did to this country.

271
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,638
The Haitians elect a priest

272
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,451
who decides to raise the minimum
wage from 38 cents to $1 a day.

273
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,518
Whoa.

274
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,021
It's not a lot, but it's enough
to upset the corporations

275
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,566
who were here making
T-shirts and running shoes.

276
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,737
So they called us, and
we facilitated a change.

277
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:54,905
The difference is,

278
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,118
my country's not some flyspeck
in the middle of the Caribbean.

279
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,621
But we've already begun
destabilising the government.

280
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,124
We'll supply the private security.

281
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,417
We'll pay off the right officials,

282
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,463
and we have 26 countries ready
to officially recognise

283
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,049
your new Bolivian government.

284
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,261
You want your country back.

285
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,973
My organisation can give
it to you within the week.

286
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,685
You've been busy.

287
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,521
And in return you want what?

288
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,107
A desert.

289
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,783
- This part.
- This land is worthless.

290
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,787
So you're getting a great deal.

291
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,831
You won't find oil there.

292
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,958
Everyone has tried.

293
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,419
Maybe, maybe not.

294
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,256
But we own whatever we find.

295
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,600
Did you know Ernesto Monies'?

296
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,102
A very powerful man in his day.

297
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,646
He had a beautiful Russian wife.

298
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,899
A dancer.

299
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,194
Well, his daughter works for me.

300
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,070
Or did.

301
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,239
She's lovely,

302
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,867
but I don't see the resemblance.

303
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,787
Why don't you consider her as
something to sweeten the deal?

304
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,628
Just promise me to drop her
over the side when you're done.

305
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,924
Camille, General Medrano.

306
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:47,007
I knew your family.

307
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:51,103
Sadly, I believe I was the
last to see them alive.

308
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,567
Be careful what you wish for, my dear.

309
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,078
Have fun, you two.

310
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,283
What the hell are you doing?

311
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,410
- You're welcome.
- You idiot. Take me back.

312
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,079
You know, maybe I'll do that later.

313
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,752
You're not one of Greene's.

314
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,504
Dominic Greene?

315
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,384
Get down.

316
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,495
- Give me the wheel.
- Navigate.

317
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,710
Left.

318
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,932
- What are you doing?
- Hold on.

319
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,117
Get down.

320
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,406
Excuse me.

321
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,658
Thank you. She's seasick.

322
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,692
It's Bond.

323
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,861
- Connect Bond.
- Connecting 007.

324
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:50,946
Yes?

325
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,198
Name check, Dominic Greene.

326
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,116
G-R-E-E-N-E.

327
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,978
I might need a little more than that.

328
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,228
There are a lot of Dominic Greenes.

329
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:01,999
Do you have a social
security or passport number?

330
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,375
No.

331
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,793
Scanning DGSE databases.

332
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,837
- Anything?
- Scanning KGB databases.

333
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,090
Do you have anything? Will
you put her on, please?

334
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,801
I am on, Bond. What
happened to Slate?

335
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,052
I'm not dwelling on the past.

336
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,581
I don't think you should, either.

337
00:34:15,582 --> 00:34:16,604
You killed him.

338
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:19,391
Largest hit, Dominic Greene,
CEO of Greene Planet.

339
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,351
It's a utility company,

340
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,896
but Greene's been doing a
lot of philanthropic work,

341
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,731
buying up large tracts of land
for ecological preserves.

342
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,818
You should be getting his picture now.

343
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,528
Yep, that's him.

344
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,268
I'm afraid there's a firewall around

345
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:34,331
his other corporate holdings,

346
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:35,574
so we have no other information.

347
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,075
Get me the Americans.

348
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,577
Connecting.

349
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,703
Go ahead.

350
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,497
Interest in Dominic Greene, Greene Planet.

351
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,332
Transferring you now.

352
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,503
Hold for Gregory Beam, please.

353
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,422
Thank you.

354
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,424
Hi, this is Gregory Beam, ma'am.

355
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,175
Hello, Mr Beam.

356
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,846
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
We have no interest in Mr Greene.

357
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,347
Thank you, Mr Beam.

358
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,474
Connection terminated.

359
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,350
He's a person of extreme interest.

360
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,709
But he just said that he wasn't...

361
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,811
Tanner, I asked about the man

362
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,564
and she transferred me to the
section chief of South America.

363
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,547
How would she know to do that
if they weren't tracking him?

364
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,616
Bond, we have your location
as approaching an airfield.

365
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,576
- Is Greene on the move?
- Yeah.

366
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,829
I've got a tail number,
Golf-Zero-Charlie-Sierra-Charlie.

367
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,962
Get me a destination.

368
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,210
It's a private charter

369
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,380
going to Bregenz, Austria,
leaving immediately.

370
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,550
Tanner, authorise a charter for 007.

371
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,138
And, Bond, if you could avoid
killing every possible lead,

372
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,771
it would be deeply appreciated.

373
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,225
Yes, ma'am. I'll do my best.

374
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,394
Connection terminated.

375
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,729
I've heard that before.

376
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,108
- Hello.
- Hi.

377
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,194
Welcome aboard.

378
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,199
Come. Have a seat.

379
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,035
Charlie-Sierra-Charlie.

380
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,426
Jeez.

381
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,261
Sorry.

382
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,809
How much longer?

383
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,063
So do we have an understanding?

384
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,190
Yeah.

385
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,651
We do nothing to stop a coup
in Bolivia, and in exchange,

386
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:39,239
the new government gives America
the lease to any oil found.

387
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,659
If it's oil you want.

388
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,579
Well, you didn't find diamonds, did you?

389
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,692
Drilling underground, you kept off

390
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:55,631
everybody's radar for a very long time,

391
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:59,884
but you can't buy that much piping
without somebody getting curious.

392
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,971
We'll have to verify the find.

393
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,069
I'm not even admitting there is

394
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,475
one. You are getting
this for free.

395
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,312
Venezuela, Brazil, now Bolivia.

396
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,641
With you tied up in the Middle East,

397
00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:16,067
South America is falling like dominoes.

398
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,783
You don't need another Marxist giving

399
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:22,323
national resources to the people, do you?

400
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,035
Well, we can hardly be expected
to do something about a coup

401
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,036
we know nothing about.

402
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,667
And I have a pest.

403
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,503
This.

404
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,176
You have any idea who that is?

405
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,604
Sorry.

406
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,776
It's James Bond, British Secret Service.

407
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,654
I don't know how I could have missed that.

408
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,950
I will need you to get rid of him for me.

409
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,703
Yeah. That's not
gonna be a problem.

410
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,639
You know who Greene is and you
wanna put us in bed with him.

411
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,724
You are kidding, right?

412
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,144
Yeah. You're right. We should
just deal with nice people.

413
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,980
I need to know you're on the team, Felix.

414
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,650
I need to know you value your career.

415
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,891
Dominic Greene.

416
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,411
- Good to see you. Good.
- How are you?

417
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,913
Thank you.

418
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,824
Ladies and gentlemen,

419
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:55,370
tonight's performance of
Tosca will begin shortly.

420
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,497
Please take your seats.

421
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,804
What else does General Medrano require?

422
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,412
Anything further from
Canadian intelligence?

423
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,622
We'll discuss that later.

424
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,459
How much more pipeline do we need?

425
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,128
Ideally, 2,000 kilometres.

426
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,630
Are there any objections?

427
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,799
No.

428
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,217
Not here.

429
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,719
No objections.

430
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,514
Transfer the funds from
our Siberian holdings.

431
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,932
Done.

432
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,438
Where do the Americans stand?

433
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,738
Well, the CIA doesn't care about another

434
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:49,901
dictator as long as they get their end.

435
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,570
But when they find out
that they've been duped?

436
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,572
I'm working on that.

437
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,656
I'm still not sure that the Tierra Project

438
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,284
is the best use of Quantum's time.

439
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,745
Perhaps we should shift our
focus to the Canadian.

440
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,581
This is the world's
most precious resource.

441
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,918
We need to control as
much of it as we can.

442
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,253
Bolivia must be top priority.

443
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,255
Can I offer an opinion?

444
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,512
I really think you people should
find a better place to meet.

445
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,686
Where do you think you're going?

446
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,959
Thank you.

447
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,263
Well, Tosca isn't for everyone.

448
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,671
Drop it.

449
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,510
So who are you working for?

450
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:22,845
Piss off.

451
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:27,266
Get rid of anything we brought
with us. We've been compromised.

452
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,980
I asked you who you were working for.

453
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,286
- Is he one of ours?
- No.

454
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,997
Then he shouldn't be looking at me.

455
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,132
Get me M.

456
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,927
It's your line.

457
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,429
Thanks. Connect call.

458
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,931
Connecting Tanner.

459
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,474
We've ID 'd the pictures.

460
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,850
Show me.

461
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,334
Gregor Karakov, former minister, now

462
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:14,605
owns most of the mines in Siberia,

463
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:18,359
Moishe Soref, former
Mossad, now telecom giant,

464
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,237
and Guy Haines, special envoy
to the Prime Minister.

465
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,613
Get Bond.

466
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,448
There's something else.

467
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,274
It appears Bond shot Haines'

468
00:46:26,275 --> 00:46:28,577
bodyguard and threw him off a roof.

469
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,417
- Where are you?
- Did you get my pictures?

470
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,794
Was this a conversation?
Can you link these people?

471
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,254
Is that stress in your voice?

472
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,881
I need you to come in and debrief.

473
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,057
I don't have time.

474
00:46:41,058 --> 00:46:43,134
Bond, you killed a man in Bregenz.

475
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,427
I did my best not to.

476
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,387
You shot him at point blank
and threw him off a roof.

477
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,472
I'd hardly call that showing restraint,

478
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,056
especially since he was a
member of Special Branch.

479
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,647
So who was he guarding?

480
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,814
Bond, are you missing the fact

481
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,358
that you killed a member
of Special Branch?

482
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,401
I need you to come in.

483
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,598
And I would, but right now I need to

484
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:04,655
find the man who tried to kill you.

485
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,865
Go back to sleep.

486
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,241
Connection terminated.

487
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,743
Restrict Bond's movements.

488
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,494
Cancel his cards.

489
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,288
Put an alert on his
passports. All of them.

490
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,624
And I want to know everything
we don't know about Haines.

491
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:15,750
Yes, ma'am.

492
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,961
And, Tanner, be careful
who you trust with this.

493
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,795
Hopefully, you're a better
judge of character than I am.

494
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,468
You want to follow your
friends to La Paz, Bolivia?

495
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,844
Please.

496
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,848
I'm sorry, sir, but this doesn't work.

497
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,225
Do you have another card?

498
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,518
No.

499
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,901
Could you do me a favour?

500
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,861
You're gonna get a phone call in a minute.

501
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:47,365
Would you mind telling
them I'm headed for Cairo?

502
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,784
- I'd be happy to.
- Thank you.

503
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,300
(GREETING IN GERMAN)

504
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,158
Mathis.

505
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,786
What do you want?

506
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,538
Come to apologise?

507
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,708
You know, Mathis,

508
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,503
I think retirement suits you.

509
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,839
None for him.

510
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,675
Sorry. He's in a bad mood today.

511
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,646
This man had me imprisoned and tortured

512
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,157
and you want to serve him fine wine?

513
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,066
You only buy cheap wine.

514
00:48:56,726 --> 00:49:00,304
And since you were innocent, they
bought you this villa.

515
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:02,529
So really you owe him, don't you?

516
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:07,025
Gemma, go work on your tan.

517
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,243
I need a passport and
matching credit cards.

518
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,537
And MI6 ran out of plastic?

519
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,625
Well, oddly, right now, you're the
only person I think I can trust.

520
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,376
That is odd.

521
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,295
But I guess when one's young,

522
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:28,090
it seems very easy to distinguish
between right and wrong.

523
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:31,135
But as one gets older, it
becomes more difficult.

524
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,221
The villains and the
heroes get all mixed up.

525
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,600
I was sorry to hear about Vesper.

526
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,019
I think she loved you.

527
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,481
Right up until the moment she betrayed me.

528
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,066
She died for you.

529
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,529
Why did you really want to see me?

530
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,074
I need some information.

531
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:02,458
You have some hard friends. This
man is some kind of facilitator.

532
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:05,920
Fingers in many pies, and
they don't leave any prints.

533
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,632
- These men were together?
- They're buying up oil pipeline.

534
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,217
Something called the Tierra Project.

535
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,677
- Do you know it?
- Destroy these.

536
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:16,138
That's Guy Haines.
You don't know him?

537
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,182
- Should I?
- I suppose not.

538
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,352
You haven't been keeping
secrets as long as I have.

539
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,354
He keeps a very low profile,

540
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:27,107
but he's one of the Prime
Minister's closest advisors.

541
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:30,778
Well, they say you're judged by
the strength of your enemies.

542
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,030
Do you know anything about Bolivia?

543
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,283
I was stationed in South
America for seven years.

544
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,526
Well, do you have some contacts there?

545
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:39,545
A few.

546
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,789
What do you want to know?

547
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,124
Come with me.

548
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:51,454
I want your hands on my skin.

549
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,657
You can't sleep?

550
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,076
May I fix you a drink, sir?

551
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,078
What are you drinking?

552
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,831
I don't know. What am I drinking?

553
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,258
Three measures of Gordon's
gin, one of vodka, half of...

554
00:51:27,259 --> 00:51:28,259
Kina Lillet.

555
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:30,504
Kina Lillet, which is not Vermouth,

556
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,298
shaken well until it is ice-cold,

557
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:35,676
then served with a large
thin slice of lemon peel.

558
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,761
Six of them.

559
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,763
That's impressive.

560
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,224
They're good. You should have one.

561
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,852
No, it'll just keep me awake.

562
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,567
So what's keeping you awake?

563
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,989
I was wondering why you came with me.

564
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:01,785
It takes something to
admit you were wrong.

565
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,166
- You want a sleeping pill?
- No.

566
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,876
- Pain pill?
- No.

567
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,086
I have pills for everything.

568
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,547
Some make you taller.

569
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,550
Some make you forget.

570
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,264
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

571
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:23,724
Good idea.

572
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,074
Thank you.

573
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,535
Mr Bond, my name is Fields.
I'm from the consulate.

574
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:44,620
Well, of course you are.

575
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,137
And what do you do at
the consulate, Fields?

576
00:52:46,138 --> 00:52:47,414
That's not important.

577
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,749
My orders are to turn you around

578
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,876
and put you on the first
plane back to London.

579
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,712
Do those orders include my friend Mathis?

580
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,506
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

581
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,759
You see that? Gone such a short
time and already forgotten.

582
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,553
You're just saying that to hurt me.

583
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:03,764
Mr Bond, these orders come from
the highest possible authority.

584
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,809
Taxi. Fields, when is the
next flight to London?

585
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,310
Tomorrow morning.

586
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,395
Well then, we have all night.

587
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,063
If you attempt to flee, I will arrest you,

588
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,608
drop you off in jail and take
you to the plane in chains.

589
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,235
- Understand?
- Perfectly. After you.

590
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:21,073
- I think she has handcuffs.
- I do hope so.

591
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,090
He blames the water
shortage on global warming.

592
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,086
{\an8}Hello, Carlos? Carlos.

593
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,426
{\an8}The Colonel who heads the National Police.

594
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,786
We have a reservation.

595
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,081
- Cémo esté?
- Very well, thank you.

596
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,541
- Your name?
- Miss Fields.

597
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,173
- You're going nowhere.
- So shoot me.

598
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,257
I'd rather stay in a morgue.

599
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,594
We are teachers on sabbatical.
This fits our cover.

600
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,430
No, it doesn't. Get in. Get in.

601
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,541
Follow me, please.

602
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,587
May I show you your room, senior?

603
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:04,838
No, it's fine. Thank you.

604
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,822
I can't find the...

605
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,241
The stationery.

606
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,327
Will you come and help me look?

607
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,760
You've been invited to a party.

608
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,471
I didn't know we had any friends here.

609
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,057
Greene Planet.

610
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,268
You're not coming?

611
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,520
I'm having a drink with
my friend the Colonel.

612
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,939
I'll see you there later.

613
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,613
Do you know how angry I am at myself?

614
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,866
I can't imagine.

615
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,495
You must be furious.

616
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,296
Do you want to go to a party?

617
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,172
A party?

618
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,134
But I have nothing to wear.

619
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,635
We'll fix that.

620
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,574
It might be useful to know your real name.

621
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,075
Fields.

622
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,204
Just Fields.

623
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,832
Fields it is, then.

624
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:02,711
We are in a spiral of
environmental decline.

625
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:09,927
Since 1945, 17% of the
planet's vegetated surface

626
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,888
has been irreversibly degraded.

627
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,335
The Tierra Project is just one small

628
00:57:16,336 --> 00:57:19,061
part of a global network of ECO Parks

629
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,188
that Greene Planet has created

630
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,692
to rejuvenate a world on
the verge of collapse.

631
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,657
I hope that tonight you make the
decision to be part of that.

632
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,035
Thank you.

633
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,791
And have fun.

634
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,543
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

635
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,338
Excellent speech and congratulations.

636
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,548
Wonderful speech, Dominic.

637
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,550
- We need you here.
- Thank you.

638
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:53,929
Miss Fields, Mr Bond, my friend Carlos.

639
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,889
- Pleased to meet you.
- Ma'am.

640
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,935
Mr Bond, Mathis has spoken
a great deal about you.

641
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,897
I want you to know my entire
police force is at your disposal.

642
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,691
Well, that could be very useful.

643
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,269
You know, there are people in this

644
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,028
country spending half their pay cheque

645
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,612
just to get clean water.

646
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:11,739
What do you think of that?

647
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,907
The Bolivian government is the problem.

648
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,659
They cut down the trees,

649
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:19,871
then act surprised when the water
and the soil wash out to sea.

650
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:23,458
I couldn't agree more. I hope
this figure is to your liking.

651
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,919
Chéri, you shouldn't tease.

652
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,080
Why don't you tell them about all the

653
00:58:28,081 --> 00:58:30,048
land you bought up outside Potosi'?

654
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,342
It's been a pleasure.
Will you excuse me?

655
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:33,760
Of course.

656
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,012
Somehow the logging rights

657
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,430
went to a multinational corporation

658
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,182
that out down the forests,

659
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:44,021
but only after our last government
sold the land to Greene Planet.

660
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:49,317
- Or have I got my facts crossed?
- Yes, I think you did.

661
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,987
You'll excuse us?

662
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,740
What a wonderful night.

663
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,620
You just cost me quite a
bit of money, darling.

664
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,415
You can't put a price on integrity.

665
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,575
I can try.

666
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,625
Oh.

667
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,882
Thank you.

668
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,927
Tell me you didn't drop by tonight
just to piss on my parade.

669
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:19,931
Or are you still after this
General's head for your mantel?

670
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,558
A little of both.

671
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,101
Tell me where Medrano is

672
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:26,313
and maybe you won't lose
any more investors.

673
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,884
You are really breaking my heart,

674
00:59:31,885 --> 00:59:34,279
choosing an insect like that over me.

675
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,532
Are you going to throw me over?

676
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:40,911
No. You've been drinking,
so maybe you slipped.

677
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,206
Oh. Just think how
much you'd miss me.

678
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,171
Good evening.

679
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,839
There you are.

680
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,635
Would you excuse me?

681
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,053
Mr Bond.

682
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,722
What a pleasure.

683
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,102
Well, careful with this one.
She won't go to bed with you

684
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,854
unless you give her
something she really wants.

685
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,107
It's a shame because she's
really quite stunning

686
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,984
once you get her on her back.

687
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,737
I wish I could say the feeling was mutual.

688
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,121
I'm sorry, Mr Greene, but we have to go.

689
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,491
Please. My friends
call me Dominic.

690
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,284
I'm sure they do.

691
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,746
How much do you know about Bond, Camille?

692
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,124
Because he's rather a tragic case.

693
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:30,127
As MI6 says, he's difficult to control.

694
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,427
Nice way of saying that everything

695
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,840
he touches seems to wither and die.

696
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,133
Shall we?

697
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,760
Doesn't bode well for you, I'm afraid.

698
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:40,929
You two do make a charming couple, though.

699
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,932
You're both... What's
the expression?

700
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,642
Damaged goods.

701
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,564
Oh, my gosh.

702
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,066
I'm so sorry.

703
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:57,946
Come on, lighten up.

704
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,073
You're cramping my style.

705
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,993
So it's British intelligence now.

706
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,620
What the hell do you want from me?

707
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,455
You're gonna show me Dominic
Greene's Tierra Project.

708
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,583
- Are you up to it?
- Do I have a choice?

709
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,459
Do you want one?

710
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:14,421
There's something horribly
efficient about you.

711
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,339
Is that a compliment?

712
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,616
Well, what's the bet that Dominic

713
01:01:31,617 --> 01:01:34,065
Greene has friends in the police force?

714
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,745
Stay here.

715
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:53,228
Papers, please.

716
01:02:03,739 --> 01:02:05,259
Open the trunk.

717
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:10,268
Now, why would you want me to do that?

718
01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:14,686
Get him out.

719
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,280
Hurry up.

720
01:02:17,581 --> 01:02:18,581
Get him out.

721
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,767
He's moving.

722
01:02:25,861 --> 01:02:26,861
Shoot him.

723
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,051
Mathis?

724
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,014
There's a hospital on
the other side of town.

725
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,474
Please.

726
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:52,269
Stay with me.

727
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,604
Stay here, please.

728
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,731
Please.

729
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,525
Come here.

730
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,363
It's okay.

731
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,825
That's better.

732
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,868
That doesn't hurt.

733
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,124
Is Mathis your cover name?

734
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,376
Yes.

735
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,630
Not a very good one, is it?

736
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,513
Do we forgive each other?

737
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,268
I shouldn't have left you alone.

738
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,229
Vesper.

739
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,607
She gave everything for you.

740
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,403
Forgive her.

741
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,324
Forgive yourself.

742
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:11,181
Is that how you treat your friends?

743
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,267
He wouldn't care.

744
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:21,900
Let's go.

745
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,125
The Foreign Secretary's asking to see you.

746
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,044
What don't I know?

747
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:44,172
Rene Mathis has been shot dead in Bolivia.

748
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,966
The police claim it was Bond.

749
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:22,502
How much did you pay him?

750
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,922
Well, he wanted you, but I left
him the car as collateral.

751
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,967
He'll make much more when he sells us out.

752
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:32,887
Right.

753
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,765
Let's see if this thing'll fly.

754
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:51,948
Here.

755
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:55,577
All the information I found said
there was nothing of value there,

756
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,830
but Greene's geologist had
proof that there was.

757
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,628
My sources tell me you're
Bolivian Secret Service,

758
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,339
or used to be,

759
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:10,847
and that you infiltrated Greene's

760
01:06:10,848 --> 01:06:12,677
organisation by having sex with him.

761
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:16,598
- That offends you?
- No, not in the slightest.

762
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,225
So what's your interest in Greene?

763
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:22,353
Amongst other things, he tried
to kill a friend of mine.

764
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:23,938
- A woman?
- Yes.

765
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,940
But it's not what you think.

766
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:28,860
- Your mother?
- She likes to think so.

767
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,741
What's that down there?

768
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,912
That's a sinkhole.

769
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,247
There are a few around here.

770
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,585
Just for the record, I
wasn't with Greene for my...

771
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,038
Damn it.

772
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,278
I think we lost him.

773
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,372
He's coming fast.

774
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:53,379
He's right behind you.

775
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,215
Here. Put that on.

776
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,511
Come on.

777
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,950
Camille.

778
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,597
According to the Bolivians,
it was a routine stop,

779
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,684
and when they discovered Mathis'
body, Bond disarmed and shot them.

780
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,894
Of course, there are no
witnesses to prove otherwise.

781
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:15,772
I need something. I can't
go in there unarmed.

782
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,982
I'm sorry. There's nothing.

783
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,694
Come in.

784
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:26,616
What's today's excuse? That
Bond is legally blind?

785
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:27,825
No, Minister.

786
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,703
I don't think I need to tell
you how upset the P.M. is.

787
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,664
With respect, the P.M.
has my direct line.

788
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:37,293
And he'd have used it if
he'd wanted to speak to you.

789
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,879
I'm sorry, M. Things have changed.

790
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:43,132
We've had long discussions
with our cousins.

791
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:45,468
Mr Greene's interests and ours now align.

792
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,895
Minister, this man is
a major player in one

793
01:11:47,896 --> 01:11:49,972
of the most dangerous organisations...

794
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,974
We've never even heard of.

795
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,795
Foreign policy cannot be conducted on

796
01:11:53,796 --> 01:11:55,395
the basis of hunches and innuendo.

797
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,647
Then give us time to
gather enough evidence

798
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,732
so you can make informed decisions.

799
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,108
Fine.

800
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,321
Say you're right. Say
Greene is a villain.

801
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,814
If we refused to do
business with villains,

802
01:12:07,815 --> 01:12:09,951
we'd have almost no one to trade with.

803
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:13,163
The world's running out of oil, M.
The Russians aren't playing ball.

804
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,540
The Americans and Chinese are
dividing up what's left.

805
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:18,125
Right or wrong doesn't come into it.

806
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:20,586
We're acting out of necessity.

807
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,842
Bond is running wild.

808
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,804
Who's to say he hasn't been turned?

809
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:33,766
Pull him in or the Americans
will put him down.

810
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:39,063
I think I found a way out.

811
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:41,941
You're freezing.

812
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,026
I'm fine.

813
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,588
So what is it that Greene
has that you want?

814
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:12,221
It's not Greene. It's Medrano,
the man he met in Haiti.

815
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:17,268
My father worked for the military junta.

816
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,854
He was a very cruel man,

817
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,566
but he was my father.

818
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:29,322
When I was a small child

819
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,575
the opposition sent General
Medrano to our house.

820
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,746
He shot my father.

821
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:40,458
He did things to my mother and my sister

822
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,295
and then strangled them while I watched.

823
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,925
I was too young to be any trouble,

824
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,345
so he just smiled at me

825
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,974
and set the house on fire.

826
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,354
He left his mark.

827
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,901
So when I pulled you off the boat...

828
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,362
I waited years for that chance.

829
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,198
I apologise.

830
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,037
It seems we're both using
Greene to get to somebody.

831
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,873
You lost somebody?

832
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:22,792
I did, yes.

833
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,836
You catch whoever did it?

834
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,214
No. Not yet.

835
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,592
Tell me when you do.

836
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,845
I'd like to know how it feels.

837
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,602
We should go.

838
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,437
You ready?

839
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,557
They used dynamite.

840
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,770
This used to be a riverbed.

841
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,915
Greene isn't after the
oil. He wants the water.

842
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,793
We can't leave it like this.

843
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:51,922
It's one dam. He's creating a
drought. He'll have built others.

844
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:24,306
Excuse me, sir. Your
wife left a message.

845
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,434
The English woman, she left
it for you this morning.

846
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:28,894
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

847
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,815
What is it?

848
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:36,569
Would you mind waiting down here?

849
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:39,071
I'll be outside.

850
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,925
So that's what she meant.

851
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,761
I hope you can trust these men.

852
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,263
Just a moment. It's Tanner.

853
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:06,432
Yes?

854
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,851
We've got the girl downstairs.

855
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,187
She says to tell you she's sorry
but this is not her fight.

856
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,855
It isn't. Let her go.

857
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,899
She isn't our concern.

858
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,234
Well, I'm disappointed.

859
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:18,819
You are?

860
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:21,030
How much oil did the
Americans promise you?

861
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,198
This isn't about oil.

862
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:24,490
Well, that's good,
because there isn't any.

863
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:25,491
It's about trust.

864
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,370
You said you weren't motivated by revenge.

865
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,955
- I'm motivated by my duty.
- No.

866
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,959
I think you are so blinded
by inconsolable rage

867
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,378
that you don't care who you hurt.

868
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,435
When you can't tell your friends

869
01:18:38,436 --> 01:18:40,716
from your enemies, it's time to go.

870
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,018
You might like to tell her your
theory about there being no oil.

871
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,229
Her lungs are full of it.

872
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:57,149
- It was Greene.
- No doubt. But why?

873
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:01,820
- It's just misdirection.
- I mean, why her, Bond?

874
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,538
She was just supposed
to send you home. She

875
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:06,992
worked in an office, collecting reports.

876
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:10,162
Look how well your charm works, James.

877
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,290
They'll do anything for you, won't they?

878
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,501
How many is that now?

879
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,246
You're removed from duty and suspended

880
01:19:18,247 --> 01:19:19,964
pending further investigation.

881
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:22,362
You'll give whatever weapons you have

882
01:19:22,363 --> 01:19:24,677
to these men and leave with them now.

883
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,640
Miss Fields showed true bravery.

884
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,642
I want that mentioned in your report.

885
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,556
Now you and I need to see this through.

886
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:16,646
There's nowhere to go.

887
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:19,732
There's a capture or
kill order out on you.

888
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:22,526
Who would have done that?

889
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,287
- Ma'am?
- Find out where he's going.

890
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,373
- He's on to something.
- Ma'am, the CIA is insisting...

891
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:38,000
I could give a shit about the CIA
or their trumped-up evidence.

892
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:41,086
He's my agent, and I
trust him. Go on.

893
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,226
- Get in.
- Are you gonna try and shoot me?

894
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:57,895
I said, get in.

895
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,079
You're gonna get botulism
if you keep drinking that.

896
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:17,039
It's bottled water.

897
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,835
It probably came from some stream
just around the corner from here.

898
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:23,462
Bunch of little kids peeing in it.

899
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,090
That's why I eat the peppers.

900
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:31,261
Well, all I'm saying is you can't
trust a damn thing around here.

901
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,020
You know, you should just
answer, "CIA," Felix.

902
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:42,398
A taxi driver told me
where the office was.

903
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:44,373
Well, if we're so easy to find,

904
01:21:44,374 --> 01:21:46,693
James, you really should come visit.

905
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,407
Or maybe you should come out
and see some more of the city.

906
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,303
I heard a rumour you'd gone native.

907
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,680
Felix.

908
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:22,063
You know, I was just wondering
what South America would look like

909
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:24,273
if nobody gave a damn
about coke or communism.

910
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:25,743
It's always impressed me the way you

911
01:22:25,744 --> 01:22:26,942
boys have carved this place up.

912
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:30,195
I'll take that as a compliment
coming from a Brit.

913
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:34,825
Are you sure you're playing
with the right side?

914
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,827
Regimes change once a week down here.

915
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:38,788
Medrano'll be no dirtier
than the next guy.

916
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:40,915
Oh, you see, that's what I
like about US intelligence.

917
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:42,416
You'll lie down with anybody.

918
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:44,918
Including you, brother.
Including you.

919
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:47,421
Do you know you're being played?

920
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,256
Dominic Greene's gonna
suck this place dry,

921
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:51,073
and then he's gonna move on,
and you're gonna be left

922
01:22:51,074 --> 01:22:52,134
picking up the broken crockery.

923
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:55,096
What can I tell you? There's
no such thing as a free lunch.

924
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:57,098
Well, you see, Felix, I don't
think you're half as cynical

925
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:58,307
as you make out to be.

926
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,184
You don't know me.

927
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:05,564
Why? Just because you
didn't come alone?

928
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,650
- How long have I got?
- Thirty seconds.

929
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:13,822
Well, that doesn't give us
a lot of time, does it?

930
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:18,410
Medrano can't move until he pays
off the army and the police chief.

931
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,121
Greene's bringing him his money now.

932
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:22,581
A hotel called La Perla de Las Dunas

933
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,208
in the desert.

934
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,376
Thank you, Felix.

935
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,587
James, move your ass.

936
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,423
Get down. Get down, now.

937
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,190
Move it. Move it.

938
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:57,199
What the hell happened?
What did you tell him?

939
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,284
Just what we agreed.

940
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,037
What are you doing?

941
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,707
The slide's caught.

942
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,960
Maybe you should check your own.

943
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,629
I will.

944
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,636
Have you ever killed someone?

945
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,225
Your training will tell you that
when the adrenaline kicks in

946
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:48,185
you should compensate.

947
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:51,571
But part of you is not gonna believe the

948
01:25:51,572 --> 01:25:53,857
training because this kill is personal.

949
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,401
Take a deep breath.

950
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,487
You only need one shot.

951
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,405
Make it count.

952
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,633
Asshole.

953
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:08,473
In euros,

954
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:10,809
as requested.

955
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:13,520
The dollar isn't what it once was.

956
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:16,314
The cost of war.

957
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:20,653
I am afraid that the corruption
in this current government

958
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,988
can no longer be tolerated.

959
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,075
And mine?

960
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:30,495
Right after you sign over my land.

961
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,096
My first official act.

962
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:55,771
And this, if you would.

963
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,189
What is this?

964
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:58,440
As of this moment,

965
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:03,528
my organisation owns more than
60% of Bolivia's water supply.

966
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:07,282
So this contract states
that your new government

967
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:10,327
will use us as utilities provider.

968
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:14,039
This is double what we are paying now.

969
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:19,795
Well, then don't sign it.

970
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:23,010
But you should know something about

971
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:25,133
me and the people I work with.

972
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,303
We deal with the left or the right,

973
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:32,057
with dictators or liberators.

974
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:35,268
If the current president
had been more agreeable,

975
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:37,562
I wouldn't be talking to you.

976
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:39,898
So, if you decide not to sign,

977
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,151
you will wake up with
your balls in your mouth

978
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:45,570
and your willing replacement
standing over you.

979
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:49,699
If you doubt that, then shoot me,

980
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:53,078
take that money and have
a good night's sleep.

981
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,849
You and I had a mutual friend.

982
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:48,813
Sounds like you just lost another one.

983
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:00,552
Not this way. Not this way.

984
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,179
I can't. I can't.

985
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:15,692
Come here.

986
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:22,532
Like you said,

987
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:24,492
"Take a deep breath.

988
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:27,412
"Make it count."

989
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:35,253
Close your eyes.

990
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:45,096
Come on.

991
01:34:59,611 --> 01:35:01,154
Wait here.

992
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:35,855
- You promised that you'd...
- Let you go?

993
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:38,733
I answered your questions.

994
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:41,569
I told you what you wanted
to know about Quantum.

995
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:43,196
Yes, you did,

996
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:46,616
and your friends do know that so
they're probably looking for you.

997
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:50,328
But the good news is, you're
in the middle of a desert.

998
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,375
Here.

999
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:00,964
I bet you make it 20 miles before
you consider drinking that.

1000
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:03,007
Goodbye, Mr Greene.

1001
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:44,090
Thank you.

1002
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:46,801
It's my pleasure.

1003
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:49,554
Are you all right?

1004
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:51,222
Fine.

1005
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:54,017
But I keep thinking, "He's dead.

1006
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:55,768
"Now what?"

1007
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:58,688
Well, the dam we saw
will have to come down,

1008
01:36:58,771 --> 01:36:59,814
and there'll be others, too.

1009
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:02,775
Someone who worked for
Greene might be of help.

1010
01:37:03,693 --> 01:37:05,486
Not a bad idea.

1011
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:12,994
Do you think they'll be able to sleep now?

1012
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:18,416
I don't think the dead
care about vengeance.

1013
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:23,004
I wish I could set you free.

1014
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:29,594
But your prison is in there.

1015
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:23,314
Fine. Anything for an easy life.

1016
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:28,236
Sit down.

1017
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:30,321
Sit down.

1018
01:38:31,656 --> 01:38:33,282
It's okay, baby.

1019
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:51,717
You're Canadian?

1020
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,637
You work in Canadian intelligence?

1021
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,973
It's all right. I know you do.

1022
01:38:57,473 --> 01:38:59,308
And knowing this man,

1023
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:01,936
I'd guess you have access to
some very sensitive material

1024
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:04,105
which you're gonna be forced to give up.

1025
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:05,357
His life will be threatened,

1026
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,401
and because you love
him, you won't hesitate.

1027
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,362
It's a beautiful necklace.

1028
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:14,031
Did he give it to you?

1029
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:18,119
I have one just like it.

1030
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:23,416
He gave it to a friend of mine,

1031
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,501
someone very close to me.

1032
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:30,548
Your name is?

1033
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:32,383
- Corrine.
- Corrine.

1034
01:39:33,009 --> 01:39:34,469
Corrine, I suggest you leave now.

1035
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:37,013
You contact your people, and you
tell them to check their seals.

1036
01:39:37,096 --> 01:39:38,931
They have a leak.

1037
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:40,808
Do it now, please.

1038
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:44,770
This man and I have some
unfinished business.

1039
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:56,782
Thank you.

1040
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:02,747
Please.

1041
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:04,999
Make it quick.

1042
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:15,801
Is he still alive?

1043
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:17,094
He is.

1044
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:19,180
I'm surprised.

1045
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:22,183
Did you find what you were looking for?

1046
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,726
- Yes.
- Good.

1047
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:28,064
- I assume you have no regrets.
- I don't.

1048
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:29,857
What about you?

1049
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:33,152
Of course not. That would
be unprofessional.

1050
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:35,196
They found Greene dead

1051
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:38,032
in the middle of the Bolivian
desert, of all places.

1052
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:40,535
Two bullets in the back of his skull.

1053
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:43,329
They found motor oil in his stomach.

1054
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:45,373
Does that mean anything to you?

1055
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:47,083
Wish I could help.

1056
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:48,863
You'll be glad to know, I straightened

1057
01:40:48,864 --> 01:40:50,211
things out with the Americans.

1058
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:52,171
Your friend Leiter's been promoted.

1059
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,631
He replaced Beam.

1060
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:56,175
Well, then the right
people kept their jobs.

1061
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:58,010
Something like that.

1062
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:02,098
Congratulations. You were right.

1063
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:03,641
About what?

1064
01:41:04,183 --> 01:41:05,810
About Vesper.

1065
01:41:08,145 --> 01:41:09,480
Ma'am.

1066
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,067
Bond,

1067
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:16,153
I need you back.

1068
01:41:16,529 --> 01:41:18,030
I never left.

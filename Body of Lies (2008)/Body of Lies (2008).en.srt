1
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,037
All clear.

2
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,248
Shh.

3
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:20,820
Ali.

4
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,507
<i>Do we belong there?
Do we not?</i>

5
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:45,123
<i>It doesn't matter
how you would answer that...</i>

6
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:49,540
<i>...because we are there.
We're tired, and we can't see the end.</i>

7
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:54,377
<i>We can't even console ourselves
that our enemy is just as tired as we are.</i>

8
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:56,673
<i>Because they're not.</i>

9
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:05,592
<i>It is a fallacy that prolonged war
will weaken an occupied enemy.</i>

10
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
He's dead.

11
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:10,294
<i>It most likely
will make your enemy stronger.</i>

12
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:14,065
<i>They get used to the deprivation,
and they adapt and respond accordingly.</i>

13
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:17,432
While here at home...

14
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:22,008
<i>The explosion occurred in one of
Manchester's heavily Asian neighborhoods.</i>

15
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:23,769
...with every death reported...

16
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:28,245
...we have to deal with a public-opinion
trajectory that slides rapidly...

17
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:32,250
...from supportive to negative
to downright hostile.

18
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:36,948
People just get sick and tired
of a moment's silence at a ball game.

19
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:39,784
They just wanna be told that it's over.

20
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:42,441
<i>Police and emergency
workers in Manchester...</i>

21
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:45,550
<i>...are still combing through what is left
of this block of flats.</i>

22
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,283
<i>They say this was not the target.</i>

23
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:51,123
<i>Had the bombs being constructed here
found their eventual intended target...</i>

24
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,491
<i>...the devastation could...</i>

25
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:54,235
Despite the fact...

26
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,435
...we have markedly increased
our operational intensity...

27
00:04:58,213 --> 00:05:00,113
...we're not seeing
any progress.

28
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:03,116
What we're dealing with here...

29
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:06,515
...is potentially a
global conflagration...

30
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:10,488
...that requires constant diligence
in order to suppress.

31
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,951
Now, you see...

32
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:17,522
...because our enemy...

33
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,693
...has realized that they are
fighting guys from the future.

34
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:28,235
Now, ahem, it is brilliant
as it is infuriating.

35
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:32,869
If you live like it's the past,
and you behave like it's the past...

36
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:36,380
...then guys from the future
find it very hard to see you.

37
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:40,078
If you throw away your cell phone,
shut down your e-mail...

38
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:44,316
<i>...pass all your instructions
face-to-face, hand-to-hand...</i>

39
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:47,842
<i>...turn your back on technology
and just disappear into the crowd...</i>

40
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:50,762
<i>No flags. No uniforms.</i>

41
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:54,116
<i>You got your basic grunts
on the ground there.</i>

42
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:56,655
<i>They're looking going,
"Who is it we're fighting?"</i>

43
00:05:56,738 --> 00:06:01,368
<i>In a situation like this, your friends
dress just like your enemies...</i>

44
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:04,034
<i>...and your enemies dress
like your friends.</i>

45
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:09,413
What I need you to fully understand is that
these people, they do not wanna negotiate.

46
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:11,074
Not at all.

47
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:15,484
<i>They want the universal caliphate
established across the face of the Earth...</i>

48
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:21,227
<i>...and they want every
infidel converted or dead.</i>

49
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:26,260
So, what's changed...

50
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:30,037
...is that our
allegedly unsophisticated enemy...

51
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:33,537
...has cottoned on
to the factually unsophisticated truth...

52
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,039
...we're an easy target.

53
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,939
<i>We are an easy target...</i>

54
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:41,639
<i>...and our world as we know it
is a lot simpler...</i>

55
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:44,910
...to put to an end
than you might think.

56
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:49,154
We take our foot off the throat
of this enemy for one minute...

57
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,588
...and our world
changes completely.

58
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,624
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

59
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:09,403
I'm coming.

60
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:17,644
You're early.

61
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:20,203
Big boss man, what's happening?

62
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,585
What's the story?

63
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,056
Rules of the day.

64
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:28,491
If the car gets immobilized,
start shooting.

65
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:30,824
Nobody gets traded.
Everybody dies.

66
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,762
So same as every day?

67
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:35,767
- You got it. Want some breakfast?
- Hell, yes.

68
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:37,795
Thanks.

69
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:40,823
All right. Tell me
something real.

70
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:43,405
<i>Oh, all I got is real, man. You know me.</i>

71
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:44,828
All right, let's hear it.

72
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:48,574
All right, a guy named Nizar.

73
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,945
He's from Aquiz up near Tikrit, right?

74
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:54,577
So he gets all fucked in his head
after the invasion, you know?

75
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:57,475
He starts working with the Baathists,
then the jihadists.

76
00:07:57,558 --> 00:08:00,686
But he is scared shitless now, man.

77
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:03,262
He's supposed
to do a martyrdom operation...

78
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,490
...but he doesn't
wanna fucking die.

79
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,794
So he's coming to us.

80
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:09,369
- He's coming to us?
- Mm-hm.

81
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,465
For chrissakes, move the donkey.

82
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,342
Move it, let's go.
Get these guys moving. Let's go.

83
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:19,844
Come on, come on.

84
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:22,744
Oh, my God. Just get the...
Buy the fucking flowers.

85
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:27,119
Come on, come on.

86
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:30,052
So, what are the chances
your man's playing both sides?

87
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:32,351
I don't know. What are they with me?

88
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,495
Three to one.

89
00:08:34,662 --> 00:08:36,027
All right. Let's slow down.

90
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:37,664
Is this it?

91
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:40,960
Yeah. This is it.

92
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:44,195
Nitrate 37 slewing to target ports now.

93
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:45,896
01 L2MDT.

94
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:48,201
On target, 15:31 Zulu.

95
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,310
Cell phone linked to moving vehicle.

96
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:52,139
<i>Stop right up here.</i>

97
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:55,612
Right up here. Let
me take a look.

98
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,448
- I don't see anything.
- I'm gonna call him.

99
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:03,487
All right, call him.

100
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:09,120
<i>Bassam.</i>

101
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:10,924
Yeah, Nizar.

102
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:16,796
Huh?

103
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,000
IR 3.9.

104
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:23,724
- He says he wants one of us to come in.
- He is to meet inside the car.

105
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:26,464
Inside the car.
If he wants to talk, it's in the car.

106
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:29,243
You have to come to us, Nizar.

107
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,011
- I'm coming to you.
- Do the fuck what I said. Go.

108
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:34,952
Hey, hey. Listen to me.

109
00:09:35,123 --> 00:09:37,475
I am not getting my head cut off
on the Internet.

110
00:09:37,558 --> 00:09:39,108
If something happens, shoot me.

111
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:42,443
- Will you shoot me?
- Fuck that shit. I will shoot you right now.

112
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,725
- I'm not kidding.
- Quit being a pussy.

113
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:50,097
Nizar.

114
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:53,998
Zooming in.

115
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,733
Visual confirmed.

116
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,344
Long wave 10.7.

117
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:08,882
Shit.

118
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:12,025
- I can't talk right now, Larry.
- She wants the house.

119
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:14,787
<i>Give her the house.
It's a piece of shit, all right?</i>

120
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:17,212
- We're getting this, sir.
- We're getting it.

121
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:20,148
She can ask for whatever she wants,
but I'm not listening.

122
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:22,854
<i>What the hell are you calling for?
Hang up the phone.</i>

123
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:24,404
Hang up the phone.

124
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:27,964
Are you on the line?

125
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:30,929
I can see you now, all right?
You are attracting attention.

126
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:34,379
Get the fuck out of here right now.
I will handle this on my own.

127
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:35,777
Roger that. Off target.

128
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:39,177
Copy. Off target, 3-10.

129
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,019
Yes.

130
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:48,594
Good, good, good.

131
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,965
You want an orange? You hungry?

132
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:56,262
No.

133
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:02,275
So, Nizar...

134
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:04,240
...why'd you come to me, huh?

135
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:06,780
I know too many things.

136
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:10,876
They prepared me to go outside Iraq.

137
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,916
What do you mean by "outside Iraq"?

138
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:18,456
They said they need me to become shahid...

139
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:20,651
...for martyrdom.

140
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:24,286
When a man knows too much,
they say martyrdom.

141
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:28,265
Who do you mean by "they," Nizar?
Hm?

142
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,236
I don't want to die.

143
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:40,642
I want to go to America.

144
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:43,644
I have a Ph.D., you know?

145
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:46,685
And they want me...
They want me to blow myself up.

146
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:49,986
- Ph.D. in what, chemistry?
- No.

147
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:52,407
What do you know
about radiological materials?

148
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:55,587
Linguistic. I speak five languages.
Five, you know?

149
00:11:55,763 --> 00:11:57,890
Nobody should say "martyr" to me.
Nobody.

150
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:00,659
- You are a rare and a delicate flower.
- Yes, I am.

151
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:01,859
- Yes.
- Yes.

152
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:04,869
So you don't wanna kill the Jews
and the Crusaders, huh?

153
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,237
What do you know about our pain?

154
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,868
Cut the bullshit, all right?

155
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:13,145
Give me some information.
What do you know?

156
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:21,881
You know, I know enough to be martyred.

157
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:25,355
But with you, I know enough to stay alive.

158
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:33,223
You have a computer?

159
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:52,943
<i>- Yup.
- Hey, Ed, it's me.</i>

160
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,918
I got an Iraqi walk-in, up near Samarra.

161
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,878
He's got a communiqué video here that
somebody walked across the Iranian border.

162
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:01,792
I'm watching it right now, sir.

163
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,523
<i>- Can you see his face?
- Yes, captain.</i>

164
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,633
<i>I am looking at the white whale.</i>

165
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:09,433
<i>- It is Al-Saleem.
- What's he saying?</i>

166
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:10,955
<i>Well, it's gotta be current.</i>

167
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:13,391
He mentions the Sheffield bus bombings
a week ago.

168
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:17,224
He's telling the brothers to prepare for
a UK operation's already planned...

169
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:20,995
...which is the bombing these people
fucked up in Manchester this morning.

170
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:23,943
<i>Let me translate this part
for you directly.</i>

171
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:31,015
"We will avenge the America wars
on the Muslim world."

172
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:35,159
"We will come at them everywhere."

173
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:40,733
<i>"We will strike at random, across Europe,
then America, continually."</i>

174
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:42,766
"We have bled."

175
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:46,737
"Now they will bleed. And bleed."

176
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:49,241
"Until they are bled out."

177
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:52,979
Ed.

178
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:55,741
It's 6:00 in the morning.

179
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,645
Saving civilization, honey.

180
00:13:57,818 --> 00:13:59,615
<i>Disks are passed from hand to hand.</i>

181
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:02,347
The communiqués are not transmitted,
not copied.

182
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:05,981
My man says that real orders
are verbal or in code on paper.

183
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,287
Is there any indication of where he is?

184
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:11,920
No, sir.
He definitely does not have his location.

185
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,500
But he did mention there's a safe house
up north, near Balad...

186
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:17,236
<i>...where Al-Saleem
may have been.</i>

187
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:19,032
Dad?

188
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,537
Hey.

189
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,677
They're killing anyone who knows anything.
He's scared.

190
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,312
<i>We need to debrief him very carefully.</i>

191
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,948
<i>- All right, so do it.
- In the States.</i>

192
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:30,447
No. Ahem.

193
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:33,143
They're onto him.
That's the reason he's running.

194
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,740
<i>- On the toilet, not the floor.
- You hear me, right?</i>

195
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:38,314
So he wants to come to America
in one piece...

196
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:40,742
...instead of going to paradise
in a thousand.

197
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:42,661
He should've thought of that before.

198
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,357
I'm telling you.
They will kill him within a few days, Ed.

199
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:49,094
Yep. And if they do, that's all right...

200
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,923
...because we can be there
to see who pulls the trigger.

201
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:54,304
Now, get back to bed.
Good night.

202
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:58,138
- Am I missing the point?
- I just offered him asylum.

203
00:14:58,312 --> 00:14:59,973
<i>Well, you lied, buddy.</i>

204
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:04,012
So just cut him loose...

205
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:06,483
<i>...and put him back
on the street.</i>

206
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:08,212
All right.

207
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:19,464
Okay, so everything's fine.
No, no, no problem. No problem.

208
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:23,663
We just have to ask you a few more
questions, and then we can go.

209
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:26,190
No, no more questions.
Take me to the Green Zone.

210
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:29,694
Maybe we could help. We have
a few questions. Everything will be fine.

211
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:32,803
Trust me. Okay? It's okay.
Sit down.

212
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:37,239
You're a liar. You're a liar.
You fucking d...

213
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:40,080
Get on the fucking... Back the fuck up!
Step back!

214
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:43,189
I talk to you! I talk to you!
And that's all you want!

215
00:15:43,357 --> 00:15:46,957
- You want to see who kills me, huh?
- Bassam. Search him. Get his phone.

216
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:51,025
Now you've seen our faces.
You know what that means.

217
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:52,222
Computer.

218
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,833
Guantanamo?
You threaten me with Guantanamo?

219
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:56,970
If you don't do exactly what I say...

220
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:59,688
...I will execute you right here.
Do you understand?

221
00:16:00,574 --> 00:16:04,510
Listen, we are your friends, okay?
We're your friends.

222
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:07,203
We're here to watch you.
We're here to protect you.

223
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:09,545
You can't even protect yourselves.

224
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,454
<i>- Boss?
- Yeah, I'm right here.</i>

225
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,291
<i>I got a visual on him.</i>

226
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:26,524
<i>Okay, where's he coming from?</i>

227
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,853
He's riding up right now.
Coming right to us.

228
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:30,961
<i>Yes. I see him. I see him.</i>

229
00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:34,258
He's coming down the street.
He's coming north towards the square.

230
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:37,728
<i>- I'm gonna hang back.
- All right, I'll let you know what he's doing.</i>

231
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:40,832
- Keep an eye on him for me.
- He stopped in front of the café.

232
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:42,610
He's walking right up.

233
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:46,510
<i>- Listen, Bassam?
- Yeah?</i>

234
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:52,717
There is a black van heading this way
with some pretty dangerous-looking guys.

235
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:56,454
<i>- They're staring right at him.
- Yeah, I see it.</i>

236
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,996
<i>- Tell me what it does.
- All right.</i>

237
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:03,068
Looks like it's parking right up ahead.
Yeah, it stopped. The van stopped.

238
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:04,431
<i>Can I turn around?</i>

239
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,800
Yeah, yeah, Nizar's getting on his bike.

240
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:09,674
<i>There's like four or five guys
getting out of that van.</i>

241
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,364
<i>- Can you identify any of these guys?
- I've never seen these guys before.</i>

242
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:14,471
We gotta move.

243
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:35,354
- Did you see a flash?
- What?

244
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:36,967
Did somebody get hit?

245
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:39,799
- Let's see a playback on that.
- Stay with him.

246
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:42,444
Hello.

247
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,930
In case you didn't see it, I executed him.

248
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,429
<i>You did what you had to do.</i>

249
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:50,677
If you hadn't, he would be describing you
down to your eyebrows to them right now.

250
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:53,149
I did it, all right? It's done.
I killed him.

251
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,840
<i>He was always gonna get killed
no matter what he did.</i>

252
00:17:55,923 --> 00:17:58,357
Besides, you'd milked him and he was dry.

253
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,288
Excuse me.

254
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:02,627
<i>Ferris?</i>

255
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:04,782
Is your silence supposed to say something?

256
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:07,129
Because you do know we're at war, right?

257
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:11,351
Your friend, who you must have had some
intense cross-cultural eye contact with...

258
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:14,407
...was a terrorist a-hole,
who turned out to be a coward...

259
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:16,236
...who wanted to
go to Disneyland.

260
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,709
Listen, Ed, we're going north now,
do you hear me?

261
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,768
<i>- We're going north to the Balad safe house.
- No, no, no, buddy. No, you're not.</i>

262
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:25,546
You're blown. There's chatter.

263
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:28,940
Well, if I'm blown, Ed, that means
you should've sent a team here...

264
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:33,084
...the minute Nizar got shot,
but you didn't send a team, did you?

265
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,455
Well, not since we've
been talking, Ferris.

266
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:38,729
You and I, we're going to that safe house,
you understand? Now.

267
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,718
<i>- Ferris?
- Where's the goddamn car, huh?</i>

268
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:41,901
Let's get out of here.

269
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:15,326
It's time to move.
I'm coming back to you, all right?

270
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:20,272
If something happens,
you'll shoot me, right?

271
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:22,773
- Yep.
- Good.

272
00:20:08,222 --> 00:20:09,712
Got you.

273
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,448
Don't you fucking do it.

274
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:14,651
Hassan! Hassan!

275
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:29,331
Urgent request you dispatch Chili, Speck
or Nitrate to these coordinates.

276
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:41,421
North, 34 degrees, 20 minutes,
16.8 seconds.

277
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,921
<i>East, 44 degrees, 24 minutes,
14.4 seconds.</i>

278
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:48,823
This is a live target, a known
operational base of an Al-Saleem cell.

279
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:51,556
- A high-value target.
- Copy that, on approach.

280
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,916
Aah! Get back!

281
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,301
Come on!

282
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,405
- Gotta go! Gotta go!
- I'm getting the intel!

283
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,268
Get in the fucking car, man!
Come on! Come on!

284
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:45,511
Go! Go!

285
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:57,848
I've got guys coming down
the hill! Two trucks! On the right!

286
00:21:57,931 --> 00:21:59,523
I got it.

287
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:01,392
Keep moving!

288
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:27,651
Fuck.

289
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:30,558
We're in some serious
fucking trouble here.

290
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:34,381
We're on Highway 1, south of Samarra.
We're being pursued by two vehicles.

291
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:37,197
<i>We have valuable intel in our possession!</i>

292
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:40,204
We're in a black Nissan.
Where the fuck are you people?

293
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:42,865
<i>- I see them!
- We're right on their six.</i>

294
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,429
<i>- Have visual, will engage.
- Copy that. Engage at will.</i>

295
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:03,353
RPG. Take them out now.

296
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:10,836
<i>Fire!</i>

297
00:23:11,004 --> 00:23:12,471
RPG!

298
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:17,804
<i>Nine, one, two, six, one.</i>

299
00:23:24,985 --> 00:23:26,748
Let's go!

300
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:31,322
- Fuel tank is ruptured!
- I got him! Get the driver out!

301
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:34,705
- I can't! He's in pieces!
- Then get the bag! Get the intel!

302
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:37,029
Bassam! Bassam!

303
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:40,667
Stay with them. We are tracking.

304
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:43,934
- Bassam!
- Get his legs!

305
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,831
- No!
- Intel secure!

306
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:49,771
Let's go! Stay down.

307
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:52,006
Come on, buddy.

308
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,547
Come on. Get him out, now!

309
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:11,526
<i>He's dead.</i>

310
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:17,301
Who are you?

311
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:18,597
What's your name?

312
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:21,707
Do you know where you are?
Come on!

313
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,134
Fuck.

314
00:24:38,592 --> 00:24:40,082
What's that?

315
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,784
Bone fragments.

316
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:43,890
Not yours.

317
00:24:50,504 --> 00:24:53,962
- They get that stuff I sent out?
- All uploaded to Langley.

318
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,870
Mr. Hoffman.

319
00:24:57,978 --> 00:25:00,378
<i>- Hey, Ed.
- Ferris.</i>

320
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:04,540
<i>- Christmas came early, buddy.
- Oh, yeah? What'd I get for Christmas, Ed?</i>

321
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:08,654
Well, 15 pages of this, 40 pages of that.

322
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:13,316
I got, like, about 712 phone numbers
that are new to us...

323
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:15,324
...that we can strip
and evaluate...

324
00:25:15,495 --> 00:25:18,589
...and amongst other things,
a safe house in Amman.

325
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:21,318
I've got jihadists coming and going
from this place...

326
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:23,401
...like it's happy
hour at the Cat House.

327
00:25:24,004 --> 00:25:25,254
You gotta see this place.

328
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:30,004
Before we get into that, I wanna know
what you're doing for Bassam's family, Ed.

329
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:31,667
I didn't know the man.

330
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:34,498
What are you doing for Bassam's family?
He was your guy.

331
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,131
<i>So now you don't know him, huh?</i>

332
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:41,113
<i>You'll be going to Amman
as acting station chief.</i>

333
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:44,642
You'll outrank Holiday. No matter
what he says, you're the show-runner.

334
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:48,957
<i>You'll liaise with Jordanian GID,
who are as hot for Al-Saleem as we are.</i>

335
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:51,482
You'll be working with
a guy named Hani Salaam...

336
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:54,165
...who is not your run-of-the-mill
fingernail-puller.

337
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:55,666
Hani is a professional.

338
00:25:55,836 --> 00:25:57,921
And will I be sharing information
with him?

339
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:00,871
<i>Let me say this about that, No.</i>

340
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:04,769
Now, you wanna take a few weeks off
and go bang the wife?

341
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:08,645
I'm getting a divorce, Ed. You know that.
You know more about it than I do.

342
00:26:08,815 --> 00:26:12,115
<i>Everybody around here screws up
their marriage, buddy. Why not you?</i>

343
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:14,147
So you'll go to Amman?

344
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:20,585
I will go to Amman.
I'll call you later.

345
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:04,203
This car is a real pile of shit.
Is this the best they could afford?

346
00:27:04,371 --> 00:27:08,025
I brought this car in case you wanted
to cruise the safe house now, you know?

347
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:11,509
No one cruises that safe house, all right?

348
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:14,932
I need to take a shit, I need a shower
and an Internet connection...

349
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:17,711
...so just take me to my apartment,
all right?

350
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:21,086
Got you in a high-rise.

351
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:24,052
Hot and cold water.
And you can drink it.

352
00:27:24,224 --> 00:27:26,174
- Great.
- There's not much local color.

353
00:27:26,526 --> 00:27:28,892
I've had it with the local color.
Thank you.

354
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:47,172
Cheap-ass motherfuckers.

355
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:54,417
Morning, sir.

356
00:27:55,088 --> 00:27:56,180
He's clear.

357
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:01,278
NSA is listening to the phones
and computer links...

358
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:03,261
...of anyone who's
been near the house.

359
00:28:03,363 --> 00:28:07,217
Look, they don't have to be geniuses to
stop using their e-mail and cell phones.

360
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,653
I don't understand why
you haven't figured out...

361
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:12,569
...that they're not communicating
electronically anymore.

362
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:16,173
The house is owned
by a family named Alousi.

363
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:19,676
And in my opinion, it just seems
like a normal Jordanian family...

364
00:28:19,846 --> 00:28:21,546
...with a lot of
country relatives.

365
00:28:21,715 --> 00:28:23,080
Normal Jordanian family.

366
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:29,246
But all of them are unmarried males
between the ages of 18 and 35, correct?

367
00:28:29,422 --> 00:28:31,909
Listen, kid,
whatever information you got in Iraq...

368
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:35,052
...I just don't think this house
is what you think it is.

369
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:39,187
These boys drink alcohol, they
chase girls, they smoke hash, and...

370
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:40,833
So did Mohamed Atta, right?

371
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:43,367
- It's Takfir methodology.
- Takfir methodology.

372
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,337
Correct. It's permitted in order
to deceive the infidel.

373
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:51,128
You've had guys watching them
go in and out of this safe house here...

374
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:52,496
...but what I don't get...

375
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:55,377
...is why you haven't had anyone
monitoring them after.

376
00:28:55,548 --> 00:28:58,073
Well, there's so much activity
at this location...

377
00:28:58,251 --> 00:29:01,709
...that we have exhausted the station's
indigenous-appearing manpower.

378
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:05,209
So you don't have enough good Arab guys
to follow the bad Arab guys...

379
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:07,244
- ...is what you're saying.
- That's right.

380
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:10,027
Well, you're gonna need
some more human surveillance...

381
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:12,357
...loaners from
Jordanian Intelligence.

382
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:14,116
All right. Skip, get out.

383
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:24,337
Now, I am in receipt of a directive...

384
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:29,107
...which tells me that I am
to make myself useful to you...

385
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:33,218
...in whichever way
that you request or require.

386
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:37,345
But it is my feeling that to involve
the Jordanian secret service...

387
00:29:37,524 --> 00:29:39,788
...is a breach of
operational integrity.

388
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,225
You don't need to tell me
about Jordanian Intelligence, all right?

389
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:46,456
They are doing a far superior job
than you are, my friend.

390
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,352
You've read that directive there...

391
00:29:48,435 --> 00:29:51,388
...which clearly states that I
am in charge of this operation.

392
00:29:51,471 --> 00:29:54,471
So, what I need you to do
is leave this office immediately...

393
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:56,641
...and hand your entire
staff over to me.

394
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:03,644
You know, we've all watched your rise
in the Near East Division.

395
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:06,074
I'll see you on the way down.

396
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,051
You and Hoffman both.

397
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,287
I need you to help me out and get
me a fresh pot of coffee, please...

398
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,523
...and a full staff meeting
within the next 15 minutes, all right?

399
00:30:26,606 --> 00:30:28,574
To be fair to Mr. Holiday,
Mr. Ferris...

400
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:31,528
...Mr. Hoffman never told us
this would be such a big deal.

401
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:34,011
Ed Hoffman is the head
of the Near East Division.

402
00:30:34,114 --> 00:30:38,414
But he does not know shit until he steals it
from the guy on the ground, and that's me.

403
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:41,138
Now, please stop acting
like such a fucking ingénue...

404
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:44,918
...and try to get me a meeting
with Hani Salaam. Thanks.

405
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,107
Mr. Ferris.

406
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,521
Hani Pasha.

407
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:21,125
Pasha? That is an Ottoman term.

408
00:31:21,294 --> 00:31:24,525
Well, I hear you like it, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.

409
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:28,364
- Mr. Ferris, please take a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

410
00:31:31,137 --> 00:31:34,573
- Welcome to our promising country.
- Thank you so much.

411
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:39,303
As reliable as your Ed Hoffman would call
a "towelhead monarchy" can be.

412
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:42,380
Well, we'll leave that to Ed Hoffman, sir.

413
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,550
Mm.

414
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:49,480
What have you heard about this building?

415
00:31:49,656 --> 00:31:54,150
Well, to be quite honest, I hear
they call it the fingernail factory.

416
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:57,478
But no one close to you would say that,
of course.

417
00:31:57,597 --> 00:31:59,064
No.

418
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:02,034
But people are stupid.

419
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:06,530
Torture doesn't work.

420
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,440
Under torture, a man will say
almost anything to make the pain stop.

421
00:32:13,113 --> 00:32:15,240
You have experience with this, I am sure.

422
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:19,842
Mr. Ferris, here in Jordan...

423
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:23,455
...to the fundamentalists, you see,
I am, myself, the enemy.

424
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:26,249
Perhaps the worst kind.

425
00:32:27,327 --> 00:32:31,627
Take not the Jews and Christians
as allies. Do you know it, Mr. Ferris?

426
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:40,638
The dar-al-Harb. Very good.

427
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:44,573
We are together, Hani Pasha,
in this House of War, yes.

428
00:32:44,744 --> 00:32:47,831
You are smarter than the Americans
who are usually sent to Amman.

429
00:32:47,914 --> 00:32:51,509
- Thank you, sir.
- I knew this, of course, before you came.

430
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:55,419
You are young,
but you respect your elders.

431
00:32:55,588 --> 00:32:57,988
- You speak Arabic...
- Mm.

432
00:32:58,191 --> 00:33:00,853
- ...so you are a secret Arab.
- Mm.

433
00:33:08,935 --> 00:33:10,129
Now, ahem...

434
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:13,136
We've recently discovered
a large Al-Saleem safe house...

435
00:33:13,306 --> 00:33:15,467
...and training
cell here in Amman.

436
00:33:15,642 --> 00:33:17,892
I would need your help
with surveillance, sir.

437
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:22,146
Now, this is what we know so far.

438
00:33:23,283 --> 00:33:24,307
This is unusual.

439
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:29,335
Your Ed Hoffman would rather have less
information than share with me.

440
00:33:30,023 --> 00:33:33,356
Well, this is not Ed Hoffman.
This is not my predecessor.

441
00:33:33,526 --> 00:33:36,359
This is me, sir.
Please, have a look.

442
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:50,606
I have one rule...

443
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:53,371
...if we are to cooperate, my dear.

444
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,813
Never lie to me.

445
00:33:57,984 --> 00:33:59,815
Understand?

446
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:01,783
Never lie to me.

447
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:08,190
You shall have your agents.

448
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:10,158
Thank you, sir.

449
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,655
Agent Ferris is arriving at the site now.

450
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,266
Thank you.

451
00:34:15,277 --> 00:34:16,277
Tracking now.

452
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:18,485
Roger that, I'll reposition the aircraft.

453
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:20,037
Slewing to 2.5.

454
00:34:29,749 --> 00:34:33,708
There it is. That's it.
That's the safe house.

455
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:40,692
Come on.

456
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:49,052
- What do you wanna do with this guy?
- Just watch.

457
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:51,831
- Watch him and what else?
- Nothing else.

458
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,403
I'm not sure about this GID surveillance.

459
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:59,425
- I can't see any of Hani's guys.
- Well, I've spotted a few so far.

460
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:03,037
You see the two by the doorway there
in front of the safe house?

461
00:35:03,216 --> 00:35:04,768
There's one more selling radios.

462
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:07,581
And there's one behind me
with a striped shirt.

463
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:09,354
That's what I've clocked so far.

464
00:35:12,158 --> 00:35:14,752
Who's this? Who just sat down?

465
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:16,519
That's one of our guys.

466
00:35:16,696 --> 00:35:19,893
- One of your guys? What do you...?
- A station asset.

467
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:21,260
Zayed Ibishi.

468
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:24,431
He's one of our contacts
from the Palestinian camps.

469
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:26,333
Station asset, huh?

470
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:29,006
What the fuck is he doing
making contact right now?

471
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:32,566
- And how come I don't know about this?
- I don't know. I don't know.

472
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:37,208
If he makes that jihadist suspicious,
they will shut down that house and leave.

473
00:35:37,383 --> 00:35:40,983
- He's gonna get that guy killed.
- He's gonna blow this whole operation.

474
00:35:41,688 --> 00:35:43,383
Not again. Fucking Hoffman!

475
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:52,495
- Oops.
- Continue tracking.

476
00:35:52,665 --> 00:35:53,825
Area expanded.

477
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,433
Tracking.

478
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:09,005
Head him off! Head him off!

479
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:14,392
- Going down the alley.
- Adjusting coverage.

480
00:36:14,454 --> 00:36:15,478
Boost image factor.

481
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:23,652
- Switching to SAR.
- Stay with sweep.

482
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,293
- Hold image?
- Image locked.

483
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:32,797
Ah!

484
00:36:57,029 --> 00:36:59,759
Skip. I got him.

485
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:02,366
I need you to come pick me up, all right?

486
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:06,562
I got bit by fucking diseased dogs,
goddamn it.

487
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:08,707
I'm by the clearing.

488
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:11,070
Yeah, just look out for me.

489
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:22,752
You gotta be kidding me.
Come on, take me to a real hospital.

490
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:25,175
- Take me to the embassy.
- That's like an hour.

491
00:37:25,258 --> 00:37:29,319
Rabies around here is no joke. You're
gonna need a jab in there, ASAP. Let's go.

492
00:37:29,495 --> 00:37:30,985
Let's go.

493
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:39,361
Let's get you vaccinated. Aisha.

494
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,558
Let me see.

495
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:05,392
These are not bite wounds.

496
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:08,796
- A snowboarding accident.
- Snowboarding.

497
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:12,460
- Mm.
- You're accident prone, huh?

498
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:16,574
Well, I mean,
I'm sure it looks that way. Yeah.

499
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:18,642
Okay.

500
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:27,014
Relax.

501
00:38:28,187 --> 00:38:31,281
All right. Let me...

502
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:39,788
My father was Iranian.

503
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:43,231
I live in Amman now.

504
00:38:46,873 --> 00:38:48,807
Okay.

505
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:51,643
This is going to hurt.

506
00:38:51,944 --> 00:38:53,878
Mm. I don't like needles.

507
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:56,344
Just think about something else, hm?

508
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:01,243
Okay.

509
00:39:02,922 --> 00:39:07,484
This is the first of five anti-rabies
injections you'll need over the next month.

510
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,279
You don't need to come back here.

511
00:39:09,362 --> 00:39:13,526
You can get them at any clinic.
One each week, right?

512
00:39:14,066 --> 00:39:16,626
- So we're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

513
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:19,600
And someone will come
to bandage your wounds.

514
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:22,668
Thank you.

515
00:39:22,942 --> 00:39:26,162
<i>You fucking cocksucker. How did
you expect me to run an operation...</i>

516
00:39:26,245 --> 00:39:29,339
<i>...when you're running a side operation
which fucks up my own?</i>

517
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:32,882
Listen, you want me to run Amman,
let me run Amman, all right?

518
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:36,078
I have made promises to Hani Salaam.
Do you understand that?

519
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:37,745
Uh-huh. What's your point?

520
00:39:37,924 --> 00:39:41,519
<i>My point is, Ed, you can't pull
your normal bullshit here, all right?</i>

521
00:39:41,694 --> 00:39:45,721
- We have to respect what he wants.
- I do respect him. What kind of thing?

522
00:39:45,898 --> 00:39:50,562
Look, you keep fucking around like this,
and you are gonna blow this Amman operation.

523
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:53,136
- I love you. Bye.
- I love you too.

524
00:39:53,306 --> 00:39:56,960
They'll vacate their only known safe
house, and we'll never hear from them.

525
00:39:57,043 --> 00:39:59,529
- Do you understand?
- I'm just trying to back you up.

526
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:01,762
It's a dangerous,
dangerous world out there.

527
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:04,748
Well, don't back me up,
because I don't need it, all right?

528
00:40:05,284 --> 00:40:08,219
- Hani.
- I gotta go deal with this Hani bullshit.

529
00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:11,754
- So go fuck yourself.
- All right, whatever.

530
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,024
You ready to go?

531
00:40:15,194 --> 00:40:17,094
Whatever.

532
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:37,014
Hani Pasha, if you would give me
an opportunity to ex...

533
00:40:38,384 --> 00:40:40,545
Fortunately the safe house is still there.

534
00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:45,481
As for the man you killed, you were right.

535
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:47,455
You made a good decision.

536
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:51,915
The jihadists believe it was a robbery.
There are many robberies in that district.

537
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:54,660
So you have been very clever, my dear.

538
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:57,200
Well, that's good news, sir.

539
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,894
Listen, Ed Hoffman had...

540
00:40:59,071 --> 00:41:02,199
I have spoken to Mr. Hoffman
very sharply.

541
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:05,325
Now, we will explain
the king's espionage laws to his agent.

542
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:29,032
I thought you didn't believe in torture,
Hani Pasha.

543
00:41:29,201 --> 00:41:32,796
This is punishment, my dear.
It's a very different thing.

544
00:41:37,476 --> 00:41:39,376
Keep watching.

545
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:42,638
Tell Edward what you have seen.

546
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:01,582
<i>Another deadly
attack on innocent civilians.</i>

547
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:05,697
<i>This time in one of Amsterdam's
most crowded tourist districts.</i>

548
00:43:05,865 --> 00:43:09,465
<i>The images of the bombing were captured
on location surveillance cameras.</i>

549
00:43:09,602 --> 00:43:11,729
<i>The blast felt for miles.</i>

550
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:15,203
<i>What was once a block-long farmer market
vibrant with color...</i>

551
00:43:15,374 --> 00:43:17,324
<i>...is now in ruins and
covered with ash.</i>

552
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:21,739
<i>The exact number of casualties
is not yet known...</i>

553
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:24,434
<i>...as emergency crews
are still pulling victims from the rubble.</i>

554
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:28,510
<i>But officials are saying it will
certainly be in triple figures.</i>

555
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:32,957
<i>KLPD antiterror-unit investigators
have arrived...</i>

556
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:36,822
<i>...and are examining bomb fragments
in the hope of determining if this...</i>

557
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:41,262
<i>...and the other recent bombings on the
continent and in the UK are connected.</i>

558
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:45,802
<i>The consequence of a new bombing
will no doubt have a devastating effect...</i>

559
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:48,269
<i>...on Europe's tourist business.</i>

560
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,967
<i>Let's go now
to Amsterdam's chief of police.</i>

561
00:43:52,144 --> 00:43:56,911
<i>We will do whatever we can
to keep everyone safe...</i>

562
00:43:57,082 --> 00:44:00,518
<i>...for you to live every day
without being afraid.</i>

563
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:02,881
<i>But we must be realistic.</i>

564
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:08,584
<i>Terrorist threats are real, present,
deadly and persistent.</i>

565
00:44:11,564 --> 00:44:13,998
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

566
00:44:16,135 --> 00:44:17,159
Where are we going?

567
00:44:17,336 --> 00:44:19,236
We are going fishing.

568
00:44:19,405 --> 00:44:20,963
Get in.

569
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,612
Since no credit was claimed
for the bombing...

570
00:44:30,783 --> 00:44:33,547
...we believe it to be the work
of Al-Saleem.

571
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:36,187
That's his signature. Anonymity.

572
00:44:37,223 --> 00:44:39,623
So, what we need is...
May I say we?

573
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:43,250
Of course.
As long as we keep it between us.

574
00:44:43,929 --> 00:44:46,261
We need a man inside the Amman cell.

575
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:47,899
We do. Yes.

576
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:49,752
And we shall have the man we need.

577
00:44:49,835 --> 00:44:53,498
- How's that?
- Because you gave him to me.

578
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,540
<i>His name is Mustafa Karami.
I've known him since he was a teenager...</i>

579
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:01,511
<i>...selling boom boxes
from the back of a stolen truck.</i>

580
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,376
<i>Now he's al Qaeda.
In my country.</i>

581
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:07,345
<i>Watch and learn, my dear.</i>

582
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:08,781
Watch and learn.

583
00:45:47,626 --> 00:45:50,493
You did not think to tell Hani Salaam
you are a jihadist?

584
00:45:51,697 --> 00:45:54,962
You have become a religious man, hm?

585
00:45:55,134 --> 00:45:56,726
No longer a thief.

586
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,433
Can it be true?

587
00:46:00,572 --> 00:46:01,732
Here.

588
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:04,803
Take the phone.

589
00:46:04,977 --> 00:46:07,411
Take it and talk to your mother.

590
00:46:08,047 --> 00:46:09,514
Talk.

591
00:46:12,584 --> 00:46:14,745
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Hello.</i>

592
00:46:16,455 --> 00:46:19,788
His mother was in the Palestinian camps.

593
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:23,520
Now she has a fine apartment
and a beautiful garden.

594
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:27,029
She can watch the sun set over the hills.

595
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:32,296
She has a refrigerator, couch,
even a television set.

596
00:46:32,471 --> 00:46:36,425
She will tell him she is proud of him, that
she always knew he would be a success...

597
00:46:36,508 --> 00:46:39,128
...even when he was a little boy
in the refugee camps.

598
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:41,145
And now he has sent her money.

599
00:46:41,313 --> 00:46:44,013
She is glad he is no longer mixed up
with the radicals.

600
00:46:57,696 --> 00:47:00,790
You are God's blessing to your mother,
Mustafa.

601
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,650
You have done none of these
things for her. But you should have.

602
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:08,171
A mother is worth more
than anything they have told you.

603
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,709
You know, you will be better in the future
because we have sent her many gifts...

604
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:15,528
...and we have told her these gifts come
from her son.

605
00:47:22,221 --> 00:47:24,746
Continue your life with your brothers
in al Qaeda.

606
00:47:24,923 --> 00:47:27,118
We will devise a way to talk.
Come.

607
00:47:28,794 --> 00:47:31,922
Come. No, no, no.
Come, come, come.

608
00:47:32,097 --> 00:47:34,793
Up, up, up.

609
00:47:37,803 --> 00:47:39,100
Go.

610
00:47:45,544 --> 00:47:49,194
And so we throw him back into the sea,
to swim where he naturally swims...

611
00:47:49,281 --> 00:47:52,045
...to learn what he
naturally learns...

612
00:47:52,217 --> 00:47:54,947
...and see how long he remembers
my benevolence.

613
00:47:56,422 --> 00:47:57,821
And what if he forgets?

614
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:03,155
If he forgets, I remind him that I have
the power of life and death over him...

615
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:07,731
...because, you see, any time I wish,
I can let them know he works for me.

616
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:10,264
Hm.

617
00:48:13,038 --> 00:48:14,164
<i>Ed?</i>

618
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:16,219
<i>So tell me about Hani's guy.</i>

619
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,275
<i>- Who?
- Karami, the guy on the bike.</i>

620
00:48:18,444 --> 00:48:20,963
<i>What do you think I do in my spare time,
play tennis?</i>

621
00:48:21,046 --> 00:48:24,296
<i>- I look like a tennis player to you?
- It's not gonna happen, Ed.</i>

622
00:48:24,383 --> 00:48:28,285
<i>Buddy, we're a results-oriented
organization, and we need results now...</i>

623
00:48:28,454 --> 00:48:30,354
<i>...because otherwise
I will be unhappy.</i>

624
00:48:30,522 --> 00:48:32,786
<i>You'll be unhappy, and he'll say, "Insa."</i>

625
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,079
<i>What does that mean?</i>

626
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:36,145
Means "too fucking bad," is what it means.

627
00:48:36,228 --> 00:48:39,595
<i>Too fucking bad? Europe is
getting hammered, boy. All right?</i>

628
00:48:39,765 --> 00:48:41,951
<i>Nobody knows where the next bomb
is going off.</i>

629
00:48:42,034 --> 00:48:44,025
<i>There's 75 dead in Amsterdam.</i>

630
00:48:44,203 --> 00:48:46,722
<i>You can call me sentimental
if you want to, buddy...</i>

631
00:48:46,805 --> 00:48:48,605
Ed, listen, Hani does not trust you.

632
00:48:48,707 --> 00:48:50,793
Arabs will only help
you if they trust you.

633
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:52,928
We need to earn that trust,
you understand?

634
00:48:53,011 --> 00:48:54,296
<i>What are you, moving here?</i>

635
00:48:54,379 --> 00:48:58,579
<i>I don't care about cultural insecurity
issues. I don't care if Hani trusts me or not.</i>

636
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,504
<i>What he will do is he will thank me
in the long run. Fuck.</i>

637
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:03,578
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

638
00:49:05,224 --> 00:49:07,021
Buddy, you're home.

639
00:49:08,427 --> 00:49:11,328
Jesus Christ, Ed,
you scared the shit out of me.

640
00:49:11,497 --> 00:49:14,350
They say that you should
never drink red wine in the desert.

641
00:49:14,433 --> 00:49:16,485
That's what did in the Babylonians, right?

642
00:49:16,568 --> 00:49:20,402
Well, a couple of bottles of that
and we'll be speaking Babylonian.

643
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:23,439
So how was your flight?

644
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:27,443
<i>Oh, it was fine. It was fine.
Yeah. I watched that Poseidon.</i>

645
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:31,942
I see you've made yourself at home.

646
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:48,991
In the words of the great Sam Snead,

647
00:49:49,168 --> 00:49:53,264
"If you're not thinking about pussy,
you're just not concentrating."

648
00:49:53,438 --> 00:49:54,598
My dear.

649
00:49:54,773 --> 00:49:56,570
Jesus Christ. Come on.

650
00:49:59,311 --> 00:50:00,869
Hani Pasha.

651
00:50:01,046 --> 00:50:02,479
Thank you for your time.

652
00:50:02,648 --> 00:50:03,910
Please.

653
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:08,042
I'm gonna need a piece of this guy you got
here in this Amman cell.

654
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,780
Don't look at buddy.
Buddy didn't say nothing.

655
00:50:10,956 --> 00:50:15,056
These jihadists might not use their cell
phones, Hani, but you do use yours, right?

656
00:50:15,494 --> 00:50:16,518
Please.

657
00:50:16,695 --> 00:50:19,630
Now, don't say no before I say anything.

658
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:22,426
Just let me say
what I've come here to say.

659
00:50:23,368 --> 00:50:28,601
Thank you. You have done an incredible job
developing this guy Karoobi.

660
00:50:29,508 --> 00:50:30,736
Katoomi.

661
00:50:30,909 --> 00:50:32,536
- Karami.
- Karami.

662
00:50:32,711 --> 00:50:37,205
Now, we develop these assets
to use them as needed.

663
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:38,610
And I have a need.

664
00:50:39,518 --> 00:50:41,349
No.

665
00:50:44,356 --> 00:50:47,943
- I'm just gonna get all frustrated here.
- Why are you frustrated, Edward?

666
00:50:48,026 --> 00:50:49,687
Because we have a partnership.

667
00:50:49,861 --> 00:50:52,281
You have something that I need
that will help me...

668
00:50:52,364 --> 00:50:54,083
...and you won't allow
that to happen.

669
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:57,329
And I'm trying to impress upon you
a sense of urgency.

670
00:50:57,502 --> 00:51:01,996
Urgency does not call for changing methods
that work for methods that do not work.

671
00:51:02,874 --> 00:51:04,933
Now, who pays the bills around here?

672
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:07,977
I would hate to have to have my president
call your king.

673
00:51:08,146 --> 00:51:10,799
Because that's just gonna
be embarrassing for all of us.

674
00:51:10,882 --> 00:51:14,648
In matters of intelligence, Edward,
you are speaking to the king.

675
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,583
- Is that right?
- Mm.

676
00:51:17,389 --> 00:51:21,155
Well, Your Highness, I want control.

677
00:51:21,326 --> 00:51:25,023
- As a favor to the United States.
- You can't have it.

678
00:51:26,164 --> 00:51:30,225
I could tell you we will run him jointly,
but it would not be the truth.

679
00:51:30,402 --> 00:51:34,634
Real intelligence operations,
they remain secret forever.

680
00:51:35,641 --> 00:51:40,772
You Americans, you are incapable
of secrecy because you are a democracy.

681
00:51:40,946 --> 00:51:44,109
Now, I know my business.

682
00:51:44,283 --> 00:51:46,717
I have never failed you, have I?

683
00:51:46,885 --> 00:51:52,152
No, you have not. Are you sure
you wanna make this the first time?

684
00:51:52,357 --> 00:51:55,190
Edward, you're missing the point.

685
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,225
Karami, he doesn't know anything.

686
00:51:57,396 --> 00:51:59,864
That is not the way
the organization operates.

687
00:52:00,032 --> 00:52:04,230
I will ask him what he knows
when it is time.

688
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:07,770
- Now, are you happy?
- I'm getting there.

689
00:52:09,574 --> 00:52:11,872
Now, you guys
might have invented algebra...

690
00:52:12,044 --> 00:52:14,463
...but we're the guys
that found out how to use it.

691
00:52:14,546 --> 00:52:17,606
I presume you know who that is?

692
00:52:17,783 --> 00:52:19,683
It's a recent photograph of Al-Saleem.

693
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:22,115
You didn't have that one, did you?

694
00:52:22,287 --> 00:52:25,140
Well, that's yours.
You can keep that because we're partners.

695
00:52:25,223 --> 00:52:29,091
All right? Now, I'm fulfilling my side
of the bargain, okay?

696
00:52:29,261 --> 00:52:32,697
Now's the time for some reciprocity.

697
00:52:34,232 --> 00:52:36,097
You need to give me Karami.

698
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,164
<i>Insa.</i>

699
00:52:44,443 --> 00:52:49,244
- That's, "Too fucking bad."
- I know what that means.

700
00:52:50,115 --> 00:52:52,310
Well, that was fucking embarrassing, hm?

701
00:52:53,218 --> 00:52:55,209
You still thinking about pussy, Ed?

702
00:52:55,387 --> 00:52:59,653
Don't be a smart aleck.
Thing about that Hani, he's bright.

703
00:52:59,825 --> 00:53:02,311
But he's also arrogant.
That's gonna be his undoing.

704
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:04,624
You're talking about him, right?

705
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:06,046
Just flow with me, buddy.

706
00:53:06,164 --> 00:53:09,861
Jesus Christ. You have a recent photograph
of Al-Saleem.

707
00:53:10,035 --> 00:53:12,663
Don't you think I could've used intel
like that, Ed?

708
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:15,306
What the hell else
are you holding back from me?

709
00:53:15,474 --> 00:53:16,624
What do you wanna know?

710
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:18,761
Well, for one thing, what's his real name?

711
00:53:18,844 --> 00:53:21,506
Kareem Al-Shams.

712
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,713
His birthplace?

713
00:53:23,882 --> 00:53:26,783
Syria. Hama.

714
00:53:27,886 --> 00:53:29,581
Background?

715
00:53:29,755 --> 00:53:34,158
Well, his loving middle-class family
got killed by Hafez Assad...

716
00:53:34,326 --> 00:53:36,624
<i>...so he moved to Saudi Arabia.</i>

717
00:53:36,795 --> 00:53:41,255
<i>Studied physics and engineering in Riyadh,
then here in Amman.</i>

718
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:45,321
<i>Post-graduate study at the University of
North Carolina. He's a Tar Heel like you.</i>

719
00:53:45,404 --> 00:53:49,272
<i>Now, he prides himself on his humility
and not having to take the credit.</i>

720
00:53:49,441 --> 00:53:52,899
<i>Yet this is the same man who will go
on videotape with his brothers...</i>

721
00:53:53,078 --> 00:53:55,808
<i>...describing what he's done
and what's gonna come.</i>

722
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:59,007
<i>His is a false humility.
It's a false modesty.</i>

723
00:53:59,184 --> 00:54:02,711
<i>His ego is more powerful than his beliefs,
more dangerous.</i>

724
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:04,549
<i>And that is his weakness.</i>

725
00:54:04,723 --> 00:54:10,252
<i>Now, all we got to do, Ferris,
is just get that fucker on the phone.</i>

726
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:15,723
Ed?

727
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:17,528
Yeah.

728
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:22,139
Don't do anything about Karami, huh? Don't
try to flip him or anything like that.

729
00:54:22,307 --> 00:54:24,468
Hani will throw me out.
I promise you that.

730
00:54:24,643 --> 00:54:26,372
This operation will be over.

731
00:54:27,479 --> 00:54:31,176
You cannot trust Hani.
Am I clear?

732
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,881
You're clear.

733
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,507
Good. You and I gotta get drunk
because I need to sleep on the plane.

734
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:41,991
<i>I have to take the kids
to The Lion King. Again.</i>

735
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:44,523
Never have kids.

736
00:54:45,864 --> 00:54:49,356
- Ed, did you hear what I said, right?
- Oh, yeah.

737
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:53,834
- Don't... Don't touch Karami.
- All right.

738
00:54:54,372 --> 00:54:56,272
Never.

739
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:15,057
That's Karami. We're on.
Get the van.

740
00:55:46,992 --> 00:55:49,153
Move the fucking van!

741
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,996
Go! Go, go, go!

742
00:56:00,772 --> 00:56:01,796
Fuck!

743
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:16,981
I thought I told you
you could get this at any clinic.

744
00:56:17,155 --> 00:56:21,615
And you should have had
your injection yesterday.

745
00:56:21,793 --> 00:56:24,057
You weren't on duty yesterday.

746
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:28,359
Besides, when you find a good doctor,
you don't change, right?

747
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:29,727
I'm not a doctor.

748
00:56:34,105 --> 00:56:36,005
The same thing.
You don't change.

749
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,399
Wife.

750
00:56:38,577 --> 00:56:41,478
Well, I don't have a ring.

751
00:56:41,646 --> 00:56:44,171
No, but you did last week.

752
00:56:44,382 --> 00:56:46,748
Ah. So you noticed?

753
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:49,586
Bad husband.

754
00:56:50,322 --> 00:56:53,450
Ah! Yes. Ahem.
Yes, I was a bad husband.

755
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:55,923
And she was an even worse wife...

756
00:56:56,094 --> 00:56:58,961
...which is why
we're divorced now.

757
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,154
It's over.

758
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:05,860
And now you're looking
for something else, huh?

759
00:57:06,571 --> 00:57:09,597
Something as different from her
as you can find.

760
00:57:09,774 --> 00:57:13,437
Something close to impossible.

761
00:57:13,612 --> 00:57:15,239
We're done.

762
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:17,671
Till next week.

763
00:57:25,657 --> 00:57:27,284
May I?

764
00:57:27,459 --> 00:57:29,654
Yes.

765
00:57:30,562 --> 00:57:33,053
I was wondering if maybe...

766
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:37,167
...you wanted to have a conversation
sooner than next week.

767
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:40,702
<i>Maybe, inshallah, later this afternoon...</i>

768
00:57:40,872 --> 00:57:43,067
...if that wouldn't make you
uncomfortable.

769
00:57:44,442 --> 00:57:48,538
Well, for you and me
to be able to do that...

770
00:57:48,713 --> 00:57:51,147
...first we would have
to have a conversation...

771
00:57:51,316 --> 00:57:54,080
...about the proper way
to have a conversation.

772
00:57:55,186 --> 00:57:57,236
Anyway, where I'm going this afternoon...

773
00:57:57,355 --> 00:58:00,552
...would make you more
uncomfortable than me.

774
00:58:00,725 --> 00:58:03,717
Well, I doubt that.

775
00:58:03,895 --> 00:58:05,726
I don't.

776
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:47,322
If you're trying to figure out how far
I'll go in order to express my interest...

777
00:58:47,405 --> 00:58:49,839
...I think you have the answer.

778
00:58:50,675 --> 00:58:52,905
- Do I?
- Mm.

779
00:58:53,078 --> 00:58:56,343
What else are you supposed to do
at this point? Leave here alone?

780
00:58:56,915 --> 00:58:59,850
You're safer with me and you know it.

781
00:59:00,018 --> 00:59:01,986
What are you asking?

782
00:59:02,153 --> 00:59:04,621
I'm asking what you do here.

783
00:59:05,323 --> 00:59:07,018
Well, I'm a political adviser.

784
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:09,951
Who snowboards in Amman.

785
00:59:10,128 --> 00:59:12,653
- That's right.
- Yeah, yeah.

786
00:59:12,831 --> 00:59:16,767
Listen, I have a thing to tell you,
an important one.

787
00:59:16,935 --> 00:59:20,268
A man is not his job.

788
00:59:20,438 --> 00:59:23,703
I mean, he's apart from his job.
The man.

789
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,706
I understand.

790
00:59:25,877 --> 00:59:28,869
No, I just want you
to know my feeling, my...

791
00:59:29,047 --> 00:59:31,880
My understanding of you.

792
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:34,382
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

793
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:46,286
May I see you again, Aisha?

794
00:59:54,806 --> 00:59:57,256
When you wish
and with your permission, of course.

795
00:59:57,342 --> 01:00:00,903
Where did you learn to speak Arabic
like this?

796
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:04,407
Yeah, yeah, we are friends.

797
01:00:04,582 --> 01:00:05,844
We may talk again.

798
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:08,512
We may.

799
01:00:08,686 --> 01:00:10,950
Well, thank you.

800
01:00:26,538 --> 01:00:28,233
He's my friend.

801
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:32,871
- It's fine. It's fine.
- You sure?

802
01:00:34,078 --> 01:00:35,409
It's fine.

803
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:38,241
What's this all about?

804
01:02:08,573 --> 01:02:11,133
Marwan showed you the burning house?

805
01:02:12,043 --> 01:02:13,343
Do you know what happened?

806
01:02:13,478 --> 01:02:15,844
I have absolutely no idea.

807
01:02:17,015 --> 01:02:20,917
You see, you could have said
to me yes or no. Simply that.

808
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:25,249
When a man says to me more
than yes or no, then I begin to wonder.

809
01:02:25,423 --> 01:02:28,517
I don't know what happened, Hani.

810
01:02:30,995 --> 01:02:35,523
We had the advantage.
That house could have led us to Al-Saleem.

811
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,260
Now it is gone.
Everything inside it is gone.

812
01:02:38,436 --> 01:02:40,255
- Here. Kneel.
- Hani, listen to me, I...

813
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:42,863
I told you never to lie to me.

814
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,838
I am not lying to you, Hani.

815
01:02:45,009 --> 01:02:48,274
You did not know that this man,
after everything I said to you...

816
01:02:48,446 --> 01:02:51,609
...everything I said to Edward,
that he tried to take Karami?

817
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:55,182
He did not know.

818
01:02:55,353 --> 01:02:57,803
When I want to speak with you,
I will look at you.

819
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:00,673
Now I am talking to Mr. Ferris.

820
01:03:01,626 --> 01:03:04,459
So in as few words as possible...

821
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:06,427
...did you know?

822
01:03:07,165 --> 01:03:08,928
No.

823
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,125
I don't believe you.

824
01:03:11,903 --> 01:03:14,235
You have 12 hours to leave Jordan.

825
01:03:14,405 --> 01:03:17,704
If I find you here,
I will not be responsible for your safety.

826
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:19,342
Do you understand me?

827
01:03:35,226 --> 01:03:37,922
Now, you knew you needed
to adapt to this environment.

828
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:40,587
Ferris, I know, but, you know, I...

829
01:03:47,939 --> 01:03:49,133
Ferris!

830
01:03:55,413 --> 01:03:56,880
Ferris!

831
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:17,690
Well, hey, buddy. Back from the sandbox?

832
01:04:17,869 --> 01:04:20,169
Enjoying civilization?
You wanna get a hot dog?

833
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:23,792
How do you expect me to operate, Ed,
when you're keeping all the cards?

834
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:26,795
- What about an ice cream?
- All Hani wanted was patience, Ed.

835
01:04:26,878 --> 01:04:29,628
- Patience. Not as a personal quality...
- I don't care.

836
01:04:29,714 --> 01:04:33,468
Not as a personal quality, but an
operational requirement, and you can't do it?

837
01:04:33,551 --> 01:04:37,051
You're too power hungry and greedy.
You fucked this whole operation up!

838
01:04:37,188 --> 01:04:39,588
For chrissakes,
I thought Hani wanted to kill me!

839
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:40,850
Oh, don't exaggerate.

840
01:04:41,025 --> 01:04:44,688
Hani don't want to kill you.
He likes you. He likes you a lot.

841
01:04:44,862 --> 01:04:49,026
And who is he gonna get over there
better for him than you? Nobody.

842
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,600
Don't worry. You're gonna
be back in Jordan before you know it.

843
01:04:52,703 --> 01:04:54,903
Back with your Jordanian
piece of poontang...

844
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,803
...that you think I don't know about,
but I do.

845
01:04:57,975 --> 01:05:00,671
You're a fat fucking piece of shit,
you know that, Ed?

846
01:05:00,845 --> 01:05:03,732
We do this shit for a living,
go on a diet, for chrissakes.

847
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:08,149
Are you quite finished?
Now, I did what I had to do.

848
01:05:09,353 --> 01:05:11,947
<i>I ain't got time to play
Patience, Sidi, Patience...</i>

849
01:05:12,123 --> 01:05:14,387
...and sit around
eating couscous.

850
01:05:16,961 --> 01:05:20,556
Hani's interests extend only
to his own little fiefdom.

851
01:05:20,731 --> 01:05:22,164
Mine are global.

852
01:05:23,835 --> 01:05:25,325
Now, having said that...

853
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:30,805
...I admit that perhaps, possibly, I should
have, from an operational standpoint...

854
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:33,261
- ...brought you into what I was doing.
- Exactly.

855
01:05:33,344 --> 01:05:36,894
What you should've done was listen
to what Hani said, and you know that.

856
01:05:40,284 --> 01:05:43,171
You know, 10 years ago,
I could've beat the crap out of you.

857
01:05:43,254 --> 01:05:45,607
Should've taken the shot
when you had the chance.

858
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:47,885
Maybe I should've.
Can't do it now.

859
01:05:48,993 --> 01:05:52,520
What we need to do,
with or without the cooperation of Hani...

860
01:05:52,697 --> 01:05:56,497
...is get our own man
inside Al-Saleem's tent.

861
01:05:57,768 --> 01:06:00,789
We could penetrate every goddamn
Salafi mosque in the world...

862
01:06:00,872 --> 01:06:03,102
...and still not even get close.

863
01:06:07,678 --> 01:06:10,238
- But Al-Saleem doesn't know that, right?
- What?

864
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:14,407
He doesn't know that.
I mean, he doesn't know what we can't do.

865
01:06:14,585 --> 01:06:16,704
He doesn't know how close
or how far we are.

866
01:06:16,787 --> 01:06:18,773
He doesn't know what's true or what isn't.

867
01:06:18,856 --> 01:06:22,724
I mean... Look, Osama fed Zarqawi
to the dogs...

868
01:06:22,894 --> 01:06:25,080
...because he was getting
too powerful, right?

869
01:06:25,163 --> 01:06:27,549
- Right.
- What if instead of tracking Al-Saleem...

870
01:06:27,632 --> 01:06:30,760
...like we're doing right now
with absolutely no results...

871
01:06:30,935 --> 01:06:34,735
...we make it appear that there is
another terrorist operation out there...

872
01:06:34,906 --> 01:06:36,601
...just as effective as his own?

873
01:06:36,774 --> 01:06:40,676
I mean, how would Al-Saleem react
to that kind of challenge to his stats?

874
01:06:40,845 --> 01:06:43,336
- What would he do?
- He would get paranoid.

875
01:06:43,514 --> 01:06:46,108
- He might rejoice. Maybe both.
- Exactly.

876
01:06:46,284 --> 01:06:49,137
But either way, he'd try to get
in contact with them, right?

877
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,745
- Right.
- Which would be us.

878
01:06:52,757 --> 01:06:54,622
That would be us.

879
01:06:55,893 --> 01:06:58,919
You're a devious SOB.

880
01:06:59,096 --> 01:07:02,588
- We can't do this out of Langley.
- No. No, sir.

881
01:07:23,054 --> 01:07:26,114
Garland. Roger Ferris.
Pleased to meet you.

882
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:27,689
Where's Hoffman?

883
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:30,122
I don't know. Ben & Jerry's.

884
01:07:33,197 --> 01:07:35,222
He trusts you.

885
01:07:35,399 --> 01:07:40,268
I don't trust him. Every time we run
an operation and I don't see Hoffman...

886
01:07:40,438 --> 01:07:43,373
...it means he's running
another operation. Coffee?

887
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:46,339
Yes, please. Black. Thank you.

888
01:07:47,211 --> 01:07:50,874
- Fruit? Strawberries, plums, apples?
- No, thanks.

889
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,470
We're tracking a cell in Syria.
Last night, they were in Damascus.

890
01:07:55,553 --> 01:07:59,683
Today, Dayr Az-Zawr and the Iraqi border.

891
01:07:59,857 --> 01:08:03,054
But something tells me
they won't make it to Hasbaya.

892
01:08:03,227 --> 01:08:07,755
We have ninjas waiting.

893
01:08:07,932 --> 01:08:10,696
Who do these ninjas work for?

894
01:08:10,868 --> 01:08:12,301
Me.

895
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:14,199
Shall we?

896
01:08:21,912 --> 01:08:25,109
So where is everyone?

897
01:08:25,283 --> 01:08:27,217
Absolutely no idea what you mean.

898
01:08:27,385 --> 01:08:33,051
- What? You mean it's just you?
- No. It's me and you.

899
01:08:33,224 --> 01:08:36,244
Did you think there'd be some
war room with lights flashing...

900
01:08:36,327 --> 01:08:37,812
...and people with clipboards?

901
01:08:37,895 --> 01:08:40,989
No, it's all here and here and here.
And here.

902
01:08:41,165 --> 01:08:43,952
Sure you won't have a strawberry?
They're really delicious.

903
01:08:44,035 --> 01:08:46,401
Yeah, no, I'm positive.

904
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:50,700
Look, I'm gonna need some really, really
low-level al Qaeda contacts, all right?

905
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:54,675
No one too extreme. Picture somewhere
in between Osama and Oprah.

906
01:08:54,845 --> 01:08:55,971
You get my drift?

907
01:08:56,147 --> 01:08:59,412
I'm gonna need a security consultant,
a lawyer.

908
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:02,804
I'm gonna need an Arab who travels
throughout the region, all right?

909
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:07,256
A businessman. Someone who fits the role of
jihadist without actually being jihadist.

910
01:09:07,425 --> 01:09:08,585
A straw man.

911
01:09:09,994 --> 01:09:13,725
Receiving money, making plans.

912
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:15,798
That kind of thing.

913
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,625
Okay, no.

914
01:09:18,803 --> 01:09:20,532
No.

915
01:09:20,705 --> 01:09:21,933
No.

916
01:09:23,441 --> 01:09:26,103
Hang on. There you go.
Second from the top.

917
01:09:26,277 --> 01:09:29,144
Omar Sadiki. He's Jordanian.
He's an architect.

918
01:09:30,047 --> 01:09:33,949
Most of his commissions
are from charitable Islamic groups...

919
01:09:34,118 --> 01:09:36,068
...who then give money
to the jihadists.

920
01:09:36,153 --> 01:09:38,621
So he ticks all the jihadist boxes...

921
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:41,656
...except he's innocent.

922
01:09:41,826 --> 01:09:44,693
So he touches his head to the floor
five times a day.

923
01:09:44,862 --> 01:09:47,422
He believes in God.

924
01:09:47,598 --> 01:09:50,829
So why would he trade
with an infidel like myself?

925
01:09:52,837 --> 01:09:53,997
Money.

926
01:10:16,394 --> 01:10:18,624
Mr. Sadiki.

927
01:10:21,265 --> 01:10:22,892
Hello, Mr. Sadiki.

928
01:10:23,067 --> 01:10:26,366
Mr. Sadiki, it's Brad Scanlon
from Hayes Andover Bank.

929
01:10:26,537 --> 01:10:28,835
I'm following up on my email.

930
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,464
Yeah.

931
01:10:30,641 --> 01:10:33,474
Yeah, well, listen,
I got into Dubai a little bit early.

932
01:10:33,644 --> 01:10:39,605
I'm staying at the Jumeirah Emirates
Towers, but I can meet you anywhere.

933
01:10:39,784 --> 01:10:41,479
Well, fantastic.

934
01:10:48,859 --> 01:10:50,292
Anything else to know?

935
01:10:50,461 --> 01:10:52,053
Exactly as we discussed.

936
01:10:52,496 --> 01:10:53,520
I'm cool with that.

937
01:10:53,697 --> 01:10:56,250
- I'm used to knowing nothing.
- I'm sure you are, Tony.

938
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:58,927
- Just get in position.
- Okay, boss.

939
01:11:01,071 --> 01:11:02,868
- Mr. Sadiki.
- Yeah.

940
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:07,909
Hayes Andover's option to buy this property
is gonna expire by the end of the month.

941
01:11:08,078 --> 01:11:10,328
We're hoping to get some sketches
and a bid...

942
01:11:10,414 --> 01:11:13,110
...by, say, next Thursday
before the Islamic weekend.

943
01:11:13,284 --> 01:11:15,218
Well, I think...

944
01:11:15,386 --> 01:11:16,751
- Yes, certainly.
- Hm.

945
01:11:16,921 --> 01:11:19,974
You'll also have to sign a
letter of intent with Mr. Al-Masri...

946
01:11:20,057 --> 01:11:21,615
...if that's okay with you.

947
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:23,478
- Makes no difference to me.
- Great.

948
01:11:23,561 --> 01:11:28,396
- Allah will decide if I get the job or not.
- Fantastic.

949
01:11:28,566 --> 01:11:30,363
Mr. Al-Masri?

950
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:31,925
Mr. Omar Sadiki.

951
01:11:38,576 --> 01:11:41,229
- Would anyone like some coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

952
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:44,645
<i>Ed, Al-Masri
is a lawyer we found with al Qaeda ties.</i>

953
01:11:44,815 --> 01:11:47,716
<i>He's fairly low on the map,
but he is on the map...</i>

954
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:51,514
<i>...enough for a photograph
to suggest Sadiki's guilt by association.</i>

955
01:11:51,689 --> 01:11:53,884
Mm-hm. You have his computer?

956
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:56,725
Yeah, look, I'm gonna go get it right now.

957
01:11:56,861 --> 01:11:59,647
He's going to the Cyclone Club.
He loves the Russian girls.

958
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:02,290
I'll call you soon.
Call you soon.

959
01:12:03,567 --> 01:12:05,228
Three-sixteen.

960
01:12:48,412 --> 01:12:49,470
Come on, baby.

961
01:12:55,386 --> 01:12:56,717
- Garland?
- Yeah?

962
01:12:56,887 --> 01:12:58,650
<i>Stand by. All right?</i>

963
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:02,652
Just getting in right now.

964
01:13:12,736 --> 01:13:15,728
Ah. This is useful.

965
01:13:16,407 --> 01:13:18,568
Very useful.

966
01:13:18,742 --> 01:13:23,611
I have an e-mail list of the members
of the Brothers of Awareness.

967
01:13:23,781 --> 01:13:25,840
<i>The Brothers of who-the-fuck?</i>

968
01:13:26,016 --> 01:13:29,770
The Ikhwan Ishfan. They're just a study
group of believers at his local mosque.

969
01:13:29,853 --> 01:13:31,821
But I can make it look like anything.

970
01:13:31,989 --> 01:13:35,186
All right. Let's make it look
like everything, huh?

971
01:13:43,033 --> 01:13:46,662
Now, make fake accounts
for half a dozen of the brothers...

972
01:13:46,837 --> 01:13:50,705
<i>...and start transferring money to them
from Sadiki's fake receiver account.</i>

973
01:13:50,874 --> 01:13:52,774
<i>Just small operational sums.</i>

974
01:13:52,943 --> 01:13:54,240
Okay.

975
01:13:57,915 --> 01:14:01,578
The Saudis will pick up the money moving,
and everything they pick up...

976
01:14:01,752 --> 01:14:04,186
They'll leak to the jihadists.

977
01:14:04,355 --> 01:14:08,121
<i>- You got it, my friend.
- It's coming up. Now it's done.</i>

978
01:14:45,996 --> 01:14:47,793
Dad! Dad!

979
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:50,964
Hey, baby. Hold on. Oh.

980
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,970
<i>- Hey, Ed, you there?
- Where are you?</i>

981
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,506
Dubai International.
I'm on my way back.

982
01:14:58,676 --> 01:15:01,577
No, no, no. No, you're not.
You're going back to Amman.

983
01:15:02,146 --> 01:15:04,842
- Hani called, asked where you were.
- Jesus Christ.

984
01:15:05,015 --> 01:15:08,115
If you don't go back,
he's gonna wonder why you didn't go back.

985
01:15:08,218 --> 01:15:10,504
I think he likes you, buddy.
Change your ticket.

986
01:15:10,587 --> 01:15:13,556
- All right, Ed. I'm on my way.
- All right.

987
01:15:13,724 --> 01:15:16,488
- Oh, hey. Can I get that for you?
- Thank you.

988
01:15:24,034 --> 01:15:26,594
Mr. Ferris. Welcome.

989
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:28,931
- Thank you.
- Come.

990
01:15:40,117 --> 01:15:45,054
I wanted to see you to tell you
I was sorry how we left things.

991
01:15:45,522 --> 01:15:48,980
- I was upset.
- Well, you had every right to be upset, sir.

992
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:50,990
I apologize for what happened.

993
01:15:52,029 --> 01:15:54,088
But I am happy you are back.

994
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:57,498
Miss Aisha, too, I think,
will be happy you are back.

995
01:15:58,235 --> 01:16:02,501
Don't worry, we're not watching you.
We're watching out for you.

996
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,990
But I need you to understand, you
cannot afford any more mistakes in Jordan.

997
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:11,142
This is a part of the world
where friendship matters.

998
01:16:11,949 --> 01:16:13,883
It can save your life.

999
01:16:14,084 --> 01:16:17,986
Why don't I call you back in about
15 minutes with all the information?

1000
01:16:18,155 --> 01:16:20,419
Well, thanks so much,
Mr. Sadiki.

1001
01:16:21,525 --> 01:16:23,390
Let's get something clear, all right?

1002
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,760
I'm not tolerating any more
of your bullshit.

1003
01:16:25,863 --> 01:16:27,888
- No, it's cool.
- Who do you work for?

1004
01:16:28,065 --> 01:16:31,252
- I work for you. I got the call, I got briefed.
- All right, good.

1005
01:16:31,335 --> 01:16:33,929
- Front? Back?
- Take my bag.

1006
01:16:45,215 --> 01:16:49,845
If you're going to insist on coming here
to see me...

1007
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,454
...which is what you're doing...

1008
01:16:52,623 --> 01:16:56,218
...my sister's going
to want to meet you.

1009
01:16:57,895 --> 01:16:59,453
Your sister?

1010
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:04,294
Yeah, my sister looks after me
in matters that are non-medical.

1011
01:17:06,403 --> 01:17:10,703
Oh, so she has to approve of me
before you will begin to.

1012
01:17:12,009 --> 01:17:15,706
I would like her to think so,
whenever I can.

1013
01:17:17,881 --> 01:17:18,905
Okay.

1014
01:17:53,883 --> 01:17:55,578
- Hi.
- Hi.

1015
01:17:55,752 --> 01:17:57,083
I'm still cooking.

1016
01:17:57,253 --> 01:17:59,949
- Come in.
- I brought some dessert, pastry.

1017
01:18:00,123 --> 01:18:02,284
Oh, the kids are going to love it.

1018
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:03,584
- The kids?
- Yeah.

1019
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,285
- Aha.
- Come.

1020
01:18:08,665 --> 01:18:11,896
This is my sister, Cala.

1021
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:14,594
Mr. Ferris.

1022
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:20,373
And these are my nephews,
Yousef and Rowley.

1023
01:18:20,543 --> 01:18:22,067
Hello.

1024
01:18:22,245 --> 01:18:23,803
Yousef. Rowley. Hey.

1025
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:25,379
- Hi.
- Hi.

1026
01:18:25,548 --> 01:18:28,108
- Nephews.
- Yeah, my nephews.

1027
01:18:34,257 --> 01:18:36,521
Smells good in there, huh?

1028
01:18:36,693 --> 01:18:38,718
It's not good.

1029
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:42,996
It's not good?

1030
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:46,135
- You don't like your mother's cooking?
- No, not really.

1031
01:18:46,469 --> 01:18:47,493
Oh.

1032
01:18:53,843 --> 01:18:55,970
What kind of food do you like?

1033
01:18:56,145 --> 01:18:57,635
Hamburgers.

1034
01:18:57,814 --> 01:19:00,044
- You?
- Spaghettis.

1035
01:19:00,216 --> 01:19:01,911
Me too.

1036
01:19:02,085 --> 01:19:06,215
So if there's anything that I wouldn't
like, would you two let me know?

1037
01:19:08,124 --> 01:19:09,386
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1038
01:19:09,559 --> 01:19:10,617
Cool.

1039
01:19:23,906 --> 01:19:27,103
So, Mr. Ferris...

1040
01:19:27,644 --> 01:19:29,771
...how long are you in Amman?

1041
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:31,604
Oh, uh, ahem.

1042
01:19:31,781 --> 01:19:35,740
Well, I think I'm gonna be for a while.
I hope so, anyway.

1043
01:19:38,454 --> 01:19:40,684
Where were you stationed before?

1044
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:43,183
Riyadh.

1045
01:19:44,227 --> 01:19:45,421
- Riyadh?
- Hm.

1046
01:19:50,099 --> 01:19:52,499
What do you do exactly?

1047
01:19:52,735 --> 01:19:56,796
I told you, Cala, he's
a political adviser.

1048
01:19:56,973 --> 01:19:59,032
Political adviser.

1049
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:02,405
But what does that mean?
Forgive my ignorance.

1050
01:20:02,578 --> 01:20:05,342
- It means, uh...
- It means that I...

1051
01:20:05,515 --> 01:20:10,248
Well, I offer my assistance to
His Majesty's advisers whenever they ask.

1052
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:19,094
But you do this now, not before the war.

1053
01:20:19,262 --> 01:20:22,095
Before you didn't consult with us at all.

1054
01:20:22,265 --> 01:20:25,530
- Cala, please, we are just having lunch.
- It's okay.

1055
01:20:25,702 --> 01:20:27,102
- It's okay.
- We can talk...

1056
01:20:27,236 --> 01:20:30,190
- I'm talking with your friend.
- Talk about another subject.

1057
01:20:30,273 --> 01:20:32,036
It's quite all right.
I understand.

1058
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:35,541
And we understand
that the situation in Iraq...

1059
01:20:35,712 --> 01:20:39,808
...has created many hardships
for the Jordanian people.

1060
01:20:40,483 --> 01:20:42,474
- The situation?
- You mean, the war.

1061
01:20:42,652 --> 01:20:45,202
- He means war.
- No, no, no, he says the situation.

1062
01:20:45,321 --> 01:20:47,107
- What do you mean?
- You know what...

1063
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,452
Please.

1064
01:20:48,624 --> 01:20:52,560
I mean the roadside bombings,
the assassination of Iraqi police...

1065
01:20:52,729 --> 01:20:55,197
...the kidnappings,
the crowded marketplaces...

1066
01:20:55,364 --> 01:20:58,818
...and innocent families that have
been wiped off the face of the Earth.

1067
01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:01,233
That's what I mean
by the situation in Iraq.

1068
01:21:05,274 --> 01:21:08,107
I can tell you what
His Majesty's thinking.

1069
01:21:09,245 --> 01:21:12,703
His Majesty believes the best hope
for the war is that it ends.

1070
01:21:13,282 --> 01:21:15,773
Well, I can tell you
that is my hope as well.

1071
01:21:16,452 --> 01:21:18,443
I hope so too. Huh?

1072
01:21:18,621 --> 01:21:22,557
Cala? Hey. Peace.

1073
01:21:22,725 --> 01:21:25,421
- Let's have lunch, huh?
- Okay.

1074
01:21:25,595 --> 01:21:27,119
Enjoy.

1075
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,854
Thank you.

1076
01:21:32,068 --> 01:21:34,559
- Well, sorry about that.
- Ah, so am I.

1077
01:21:34,737 --> 01:21:38,491
I probably should've kept my mouth shut.
After all, I was a guest in your home.

1078
01:21:38,574 --> 01:21:40,804
So is she. It didn't
stop her, you know?

1079
01:21:40,977 --> 01:21:44,310
She suffered a lot during Iran-Iraq war.

1080
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:48,507
And the funny thing
is that she wants to live in America.

1081
01:21:48,684 --> 01:21:49,742
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1082
01:21:49,919 --> 01:21:53,339
Well, tell her I'll switch passports
with her. It'll make us both happy.

1083
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:55,322
Don't joke about these kind of things.

1084
01:21:55,491 --> 01:22:00,258
I'm not joking. I'm perfectly serious.
I may stay here forever. Really.

1085
01:22:01,898 --> 01:22:05,251
Well, anyway, I'm glad I made friends
with her boys. I like them a lot.

1086
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:07,165
Yeah, they're great, aren't they?

1087
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:10,567
But not very good spies, you know?
Neither are you.

1088
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:11,764
What do you mean?

1089
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:13,441
- At the table, you know?
- Oh.

1090
01:22:14,177 --> 01:22:17,010
So you noticed. All right.
I'm busted.

1091
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:20,172
Well, thank you, Aisha,
for inviting me in your home.

1092
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:21,942
Um...

1093
01:22:27,723 --> 01:22:29,384
Sorry.

1094
01:22:30,193 --> 01:22:32,643
- I had a really nice time.
- Sorry. Yeah, me too.

1095
01:22:33,262 --> 01:22:36,459
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

1096
01:22:46,576 --> 01:22:50,774
The photograph was taken last week
in the Cyclone Club in Dubai.

1097
01:22:50,947 --> 01:22:52,539
One is Al-Masri, a lawyer...

1098
01:22:52,715 --> 01:22:57,652
...a low-level al Qaeda financier,
if that's not a contradiction in terms.

1099
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:00,254
The other is a Jordanian.

1100
01:23:00,423 --> 01:23:03,119
An architect named Omar Sadiki.

1101
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:06,088
No known terrorist ties.

1102
01:23:06,262 --> 01:23:12,132
Now, the question I ask myself is,
is what are they doing together?

1103
01:23:17,006 --> 01:23:19,998
Is this Sadiki more than he claims to be?

1104
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:21,770
He travels a lot.

1105
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:25,146
He builds mosques and shopping malls.

1106
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:28,249
At the very least,
he bears examination by us.

1107
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:30,408
Or by we.

1108
01:23:30,853 --> 01:23:32,286
Hm.

1109
01:23:33,923 --> 01:23:35,185
Where'd you get these?

1110
01:23:36,192 --> 01:23:38,456
- A friend in Saudi Intelligence.
- Mm.

1111
01:23:39,161 --> 01:23:40,594
Useful friend, huh?

1112
01:23:49,772 --> 01:23:51,205
No, keep it.

1113
01:23:51,874 --> 01:23:53,933
I want you to have it.

1114
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:57,477
We are partners. Allies, no?

1115
01:23:58,514 --> 01:24:01,347
Why would we not want to help each other?

1116
01:24:01,517 --> 01:24:04,611
Right. Thank you.

1117
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:06,888
<i>- Garland.
- Yeah?</i>

1118
01:24:07,023 --> 01:24:10,176
<i>Pull up an Arabic keyboard
and write down this message, you ready?</i>

1119
01:24:10,259 --> 01:24:11,283
Okay.

1120
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:14,010
In the name of Go...
No, you know what, strike that.

1121
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:16,496
In the name of God the merciful...

1122
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:19,157
<i>...we praise our brothers
who shall carry out...</i>

1123
01:24:19,335 --> 01:24:21,701
<i>...this heroic act in
the fig orchard...</i>

1124
01:24:21,871 --> 01:24:24,971
...and beg God to give us strength
for our continuing struggle.

1125
01:24:25,141 --> 01:24:27,371
The time is at hand. All right?

1126
01:24:27,543 --> 01:24:31,502
Now, that's absolutely delightful Arabic,
but what the fuck is the fig orchard?

1127
01:24:31,681 --> 01:24:34,734
<i>I can't let you in on that yet.
Let's just say it's developing.</i>

1128
01:24:34,817 --> 01:24:36,011
It'll create chatter...

1129
01:24:36,185 --> 01:24:39,643
...but it's gotta be big enough
for Al-Saleem, to get his attention.

1130
01:24:40,089 --> 01:24:41,249
Oh, it'll be big.

1131
01:24:41,424 --> 01:24:44,257
Now, send that off
from Sadiki's fake e-mail address...

1132
01:24:44,427 --> 01:24:46,088
<i>...and we are in business.</i>

1133
01:24:46,262 --> 01:24:47,524
Okay. Done.

1134
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:03,237
<i>Advise when you're on the deck.</i>

1135
01:25:14,223 --> 01:25:17,192
<i>Hello there, Mr. Sadiki.
It's Brad Scanlon.</i>

1136
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,023
I'm fine. Thanks so much for asking.
But we've got a bit of a problem.

1137
01:25:21,197 --> 01:25:23,997
You see, our chief engineer,
who's based out of Ankara...

1138
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:27,727
...he's raised some issues
about the insulation.

1139
01:25:27,903 --> 01:25:30,790
I realize it's the same stuff
that you use in Saudi Arabia...

1140
01:25:30,873 --> 01:25:34,434
...but he's asked
to meet with you immediately.

1141
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:37,545
No, I'm sorry, sir.
He cannot fly up to see you.

1142
01:25:37,713 --> 01:25:40,910
And the only time he can meet
is tomorrow afternoon.

1143
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:44,985
But the good news is, we have a car
ready to pick you up in about...

1144
01:25:45,154 --> 01:25:49,818
...oh, six hours, and a plane ticket to
Turkey waiting for you at the airport.

1145
01:25:50,626 --> 01:25:53,595
No, I'm sorry, sir.
First class was not available.

1146
01:25:54,697 --> 01:25:56,892
<i>Ed, Sadiki just landed in Turkey.</i>

1147
01:25:57,066 --> 01:25:58,897
<i>He's being met by one of our guys.</i>

1148
01:25:59,068 --> 01:26:02,595
<i>An engineer to discuss business
and to show him a good time.</i>

1149
01:26:02,772 --> 01:26:05,206
<i>All we need is to establish
that he is there.</i>

1150
01:26:05,408 --> 01:26:07,493
<i>- Mm-hm.
- Now, the barracks at the base...</i>

1151
01:26:07,576 --> 01:26:09,626
<i>...have been cleared
out of all personnel.</i>

1152
01:26:09,712 --> 01:26:11,862
<i>Bodies from the morgue
have been brought in.</i>

1153
01:26:11,981 --> 01:26:14,882
<i>They'll be our so-called casualties.</i>

1154
01:26:15,051 --> 01:26:19,420
<i>Now, Garland will send out a message from
Sadiki hinting that a strike is prepared.</i>

1155
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:21,074
And when the strike is done...

1156
01:26:21,157 --> 01:26:24,757
...he'll post another message taking
responsibility for our little event.

1157
01:26:24,927 --> 01:26:26,895
- You got that?
- Uh-huh.

1158
01:26:27,063 --> 01:26:28,325
<i>After that...</i>

1159
01:26:28,497 --> 01:26:32,197
...hopefully a buzz of messages will
then pass among jihadists' networks...

1160
01:26:32,368 --> 01:26:36,464
<i>...announcing the Brothers of Awareness
as a new player.</i>

1161
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:39,301
And our Sadiki as its leader.
You got that?

1162
01:26:39,475 --> 01:26:41,136
<i>All right, Ferris. Thank you.</i>

1163
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:42,790
<i>Tony, you have a go.</i>

1164
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:51,882
<i>We have a special report.</i>

1165
01:26:52,054 --> 01:26:55,114
<i>A massive explosion
has taken place in Incirlik, Turkey.</i>

1166
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:58,991
<i>Officials have confirmed the target
of the blast to be the U.S. Air Base...</i>

1167
01:26:59,795 --> 01:27:03,583
<i>...at Incirlik, Turkey. The bomb ripped
through the Bachelor Officers' Quarters...</i>

1168
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:06,416
<i>...at 3:00 this morning,
quickly engulfing it in flames.</i>

1169
01:27:07,369 --> 01:27:09,997
<i>No one yet has claimed responsibility
for the attack.</i>

1170
01:27:10,172 --> 01:27:13,869
<i>But terror experts are already speculating
this is the work of a new...</i>

1171
01:27:14,043 --> 01:27:17,730
<i>...much more sophisticated and much
better financed offshoot of al Qaeda...</i>

1172
01:27:17,813 --> 01:27:20,333
<i>...than that which is responsible
for the bombings...</i>

1173
01:27:20,416 --> 01:27:23,180
<i>...in Amsterdam, London
and other European cities.</i>

1174
01:27:23,352 --> 01:27:25,271
<i>In contrast to these recent bombings...</i>

1175
01:27:25,354 --> 01:27:28,812
<i>...this is the first attack
to occur on American property.</i>

1176
01:27:28,991 --> 01:27:30,271
<i>- The Pentagon...
- Honey.</i>

1177
01:27:30,426 --> 01:27:34,047
<i>...will not release the names of the dead
until notification of next of kin.</i>

1178
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:36,949
<i>We're also being told that there
may never be a public announcement...</i>

1179
01:27:37,032 --> 01:27:38,056
Honey.

1180
01:27:38,234 --> 01:27:40,453
<i>...of the list of casualties
since some of the men killed...</i>

1181
01:27:40,536 --> 01:27:43,489
<i>...may have been stationed at Incirlik
on classified missions.</i>

1182
01:27:43,572 --> 01:27:47,527
<i>Incirlik, which in Turkish means fig orchard,
has served since September the 11 th...</i>

1183
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:51,068
<i>...as a primary hub in the wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq.</i>

1184
01:27:51,247 --> 01:27:54,705
All right, now send out the message
taking credit.

1185
01:27:54,884 --> 01:27:58,581
But make the responses go back
to Sadiki's actual account.

1186
01:27:58,754 --> 01:28:01,245
<i>- You got that?
- Okay.</i>

1187
01:28:06,228 --> 01:28:10,858
I can't say it's been real,
but you know what I mean.

1188
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,558
Yeah.

1189
01:31:46,747 --> 01:31:48,467
<i>Hey there, little buddy.</i>

1190
01:31:48,982 --> 01:31:52,748
<i>Well done. You did it.
NSA's picking up all kinds of chatter.</i>

1191
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,120
<i>Haven't heard for years.</i>

1192
01:31:54,254 --> 01:31:58,213
One voice on a world phone out of Vienna
sounds a lot like Al-Saleem himself.

1193
01:31:58,392 --> 01:32:01,942
<i>Saying something along the lines of,
"Who the damn heck is Omar Sadiki?"</i>

1194
01:32:02,095 --> 01:32:06,259
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen, I made
a decision, Ed. I'm bringing him in.

1195
01:32:06,433 --> 01:32:09,095
<i>- Who?
- Omar Sadiki, that's who.</i>

1196
01:32:09,269 --> 01:32:10,827
Oh, come on. No, no, no.

1197
01:32:11,004 --> 01:32:14,704
When they find him, they are gonna
torture him and they are gonna kill him.

1198
01:32:14,808 --> 01:32:18,596
You gotta decide which side of the cross
you're on. I need nailers, not hangers.

1199
01:32:18,679 --> 01:32:21,079
Decision's already done, Ed.
I'm bringing him in.

1200
01:32:21,181 --> 01:32:24,150
Ain't nobody innocent
in this shit, Ferris. Okay?

1201
01:32:25,385 --> 01:32:26,409
Ferris.

1202
01:32:27,254 --> 01:32:30,052
All right, don't
move until I say, all right?

1203
01:32:35,829 --> 01:32:37,296
<i>You got me?</i>

1204
01:32:44,004 --> 01:32:45,494
Omar.

1205
01:32:45,672 --> 01:32:48,526
It's Brad Scanlon.
We need to have a conversation. Come on.

1206
01:32:48,609 --> 01:32:50,509
What are you doing here?

1207
01:32:55,716 --> 01:32:58,776
Fuck! Omar! Omar, open the door!

1208
01:32:58,952 --> 01:33:00,010
Let's go!

1209
01:33:00,187 --> 01:33:02,553
Omar, listen to me!

1210
01:33:02,723 --> 01:33:04,315
Omar! Omar!

1211
01:33:04,992 --> 01:33:07,222
Let's go! Go, go, go!

1212
01:33:19,973 --> 01:33:21,463
Fuck!

1213
01:33:29,016 --> 01:33:31,883
This is Roger Ferris.
I need an ambulance.

1214
01:35:33,407 --> 01:35:35,170
Yeah.

1215
01:35:35,342 --> 01:35:37,469
<i>Sadiki is dead.</i>

1216
01:35:38,445 --> 01:35:40,106
<i>You there?</i>

1217
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,645
Yeah, I'm here.

1218
01:35:41,815 --> 01:35:43,715
I didn't kill him, buddy.

1219
01:35:43,884 --> 01:35:45,044
<i>I know you didn't, Ed.</i>

1220
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,244
I did.

1221
01:35:48,422 --> 01:35:52,017
Oh, buddy.
Buddy, that's just not constructive. Okay?

1222
01:35:52,192 --> 01:35:55,127
- Then what is?
- Doing exactly what you're doing.

1223
01:35:55,295 --> 01:35:59,145
And how are you measuring that? By how
much closer you've gotten to Al-Saleem?

1224
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:02,497
I bet you heard a shitload of chatter,
then it stopped, didn't it?

1225
01:36:02,669 --> 01:36:03,966
That's right.

1226
01:36:04,137 --> 01:36:06,128
<i>Well, then where is Al-Saleem?</i>

1227
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,508
- Hm?
- Ferris.

1228
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:12,542
You know what? I've had it.

1229
01:36:12,712 --> 01:36:14,646
I've had it. I can't
do this anymore.

1230
01:36:15,415 --> 01:36:16,439
Yes, you can.

1231
01:36:16,616 --> 01:36:19,244
Now, you just get yourself
a couple of hours' sleep.

1232
01:36:19,419 --> 01:36:21,405
And call me when you're thinking straight.

1233
01:36:21,488 --> 01:36:25,424
You know what? I am thinking straight.
You're not, all right?

1234
01:36:25,592 --> 01:36:28,322
You can't, because you're
a million fucking miles away.

1235
01:36:28,495 --> 01:36:29,962
I'm here, Ed, every day.

1236
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:32,549
And I see the unnecessary travesties
of this war...

1237
01:36:32,632 --> 01:36:36,068
<i>...that the rest of you backstabbing
political fucking bureaucrats...</i>

1238
01:36:36,236 --> 01:36:37,621
<i>...only look at pictures of.</i>

1239
01:36:37,704 --> 01:36:41,003
So don't you dare tell me
I am not fucking thinking straight!

1240
01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:44,771
This is not working, all right?

1241
01:36:44,945 --> 01:36:47,004
<i>It's not working. I'm out.</i>

1242
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,171
Ferris?

1243
01:36:49,349 --> 01:36:51,340
Ferris?

1244
01:36:54,621 --> 01:36:56,646
I should pack.

1245
01:37:15,175 --> 01:37:17,234
Fuck.

1246
01:37:22,782 --> 01:37:24,374
Fuck!

1247
01:37:43,737 --> 01:37:45,295
Shit!

1248
01:37:45,972 --> 01:37:47,963
Move the fucking car!

1249
01:38:55,675 --> 01:38:57,516
- Where's Marwan? Marwan?
- Mr. Ferris.

1250
01:38:57,577 --> 01:38:59,135
Please.

1251
01:39:00,580 --> 01:39:03,433
Please, please. I just need a
moment of his time, all right?

1252
01:39:03,516 --> 01:39:05,313
Okay.

1253
01:39:11,024 --> 01:39:12,548
Please?

1254
01:39:14,294 --> 01:39:16,228
Please excuse me.

1255
01:39:23,103 --> 01:39:24,866
What is it?

1256
01:39:31,144 --> 01:39:34,170
I invented Omar Sadiki.

1257
01:39:34,347 --> 01:39:37,510
It was my operation.
He is not a jihadist, all right?

1258
01:39:37,684 --> 01:39:41,780
I moved him around, I moved money around,
and then I lost him.

1259
01:39:41,955 --> 01:39:44,355
- That is impossible.
- Why?

1260
01:39:44,524 --> 01:39:48,585
Because it will mean that you sat
in my office and you lied to my face.

1261
01:39:48,762 --> 01:39:52,562
Hani, I promise I will share
all the information with you, all right?

1262
01:39:52,732 --> 01:39:56,065
But they have kidnapped a friend of mine
in order to get to me.

1263
01:39:56,236 --> 01:39:58,686
Now, you know exactly
who I'm talking about, Hani.

1264
01:39:58,805 --> 01:40:02,241
Please, they're gonna execute her,
all right?

1265
01:40:02,409 --> 01:40:04,877
Please, help me broker a deal, her for me.

1266
01:40:05,045 --> 01:40:07,013
You lied to me.

1267
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:08,647
I will not help you.

1268
01:40:08,815 --> 01:40:11,113
- The answer is no.
- Please, Hani.

1269
01:40:11,284 --> 01:40:13,752
Hani. Hani!

1270
01:40:32,405 --> 01:40:33,838
Ed.

1271
01:40:34,007 --> 01:40:37,057
You should've told me about the girl.
We could've watched her.

1272
01:40:37,143 --> 01:40:39,129
They left the phone.
I know how this goes.

1273
01:40:39,212 --> 01:40:41,339
They've got Aisha and they want someone.

1274
01:40:41,514 --> 01:40:45,280
- If she's alive.
- She has to be alive, right?

1275
01:40:45,752 --> 01:40:48,902
Well, she's probably alive.
At least, they want you to think so.

1276
01:40:49,022 --> 01:40:51,308
- That's the good part.
- And what's the bad part?

1277
01:40:51,391 --> 01:40:52,858
They know about you.

1278
01:40:53,026 --> 01:40:56,154
They know you work for the agency.
That tells me two things.

1279
01:40:56,329 --> 01:40:58,949
One, the people that have Aisha
are running the show...

1280
01:40:59,032 --> 01:41:00,632
...so they're close
to Al-Saleem.

1281
01:41:00,734 --> 01:41:03,884
Two, they have learned enough
from Aisha to know she's your pal.

1282
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:05,938
- She's been interrogated.
- Goddamn it.

1283
01:41:06,106 --> 01:41:08,592
- You cannot take this to Hani, right?
- Right. Right.

1284
01:41:08,675 --> 01:41:12,270
- Does that mean you already have?
- Yes. Yes, sir, I have.

1285
01:41:12,445 --> 01:41:13,545
Why would you do that?

1286
01:41:13,646 --> 01:41:15,632
I have to trust everyone I can right now.

1287
01:41:15,715 --> 01:41:18,115
All you gotta do is trust me.

1288
01:41:18,651 --> 01:41:20,171
<i>- What'd he say?
- He said, "Ma'alesh."</i>

1289
01:41:20,253 --> 01:41:22,353
Because I lied to him,
he's not gonna help.

1290
01:41:30,096 --> 01:41:32,496
Okay. We set this up,
we're gonna do it right.

1291
01:41:32,665 --> 01:41:35,725
- It's not just about you and your girlfriend.
- All right.

1292
01:41:38,004 --> 01:41:41,804
This is Roger Ferris.
Will you put Aisha on the phone?

1293
01:41:41,975 --> 01:41:44,808
<i>Okay, mister. Thanks God you are calling.</i>

1294
01:41:44,978 --> 01:41:48,311
<i>I have a question
to make sure you are you. Please.</i>

1295
01:41:48,481 --> 01:41:49,505
Fine.

1296
01:41:49,682 --> 01:41:51,912
<i>Where do you meet Miss Aisha first time?</i>

1297
01:41:52,085 --> 01:41:56,681
<i>At a medical clinic in Amman.
She's a nurse.</i>

1298
01:41:56,856 --> 01:41:59,791
<i>Where do you take Miss Aisha
for dinner first time?</i>

1299
01:41:59,959 --> 01:42:01,756
Go, go.

1300
01:42:01,961 --> 01:42:03,292
Uh...

1301
01:42:03,463 --> 01:42:07,399
I didn't. She invited me
to her apartment for dinner.

1302
01:42:07,567 --> 01:42:09,057
<i>Did you bring anything?</i>

1303
01:42:10,804 --> 01:42:12,533
<i>I did.</i>

1304
01:42:13,339 --> 01:42:16,103
A dessert pastry.

1305
01:42:16,276 --> 01:42:19,370
<i>If you want to see Miss Aisha,
you must go where I say.</i>

1306
01:42:20,013 --> 01:42:23,972
<i>Trade you for her.
No trick or Miss Aisha will die.</i>

1307
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:25,742
Tell me where I'm to go.

1308
01:42:26,219 --> 01:42:27,777
<i>I'll tell you where to go.</i>

1309
01:42:27,954 --> 01:42:30,889
<i>It is near the border.
Highway 15.</i>

1310
01:42:31,057 --> 01:42:34,083
<i>Between Al-Saidi and Mahbrouk.</i>

1311
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:36,091
<i>That's where you go. Bye.</i>

1312
01:43:14,367 --> 01:43:15,732
Passport.

1313
01:45:08,247 --> 01:45:09,441
Bring up Pacman feed.

1314
01:45:09,616 --> 01:45:11,345
Increase magnification eight time.

1315
01:45:11,517 --> 01:45:13,576
Eight-time mag.

1316
01:45:14,621 --> 01:45:15,781
Enhance resolution.

1317
01:45:33,473 --> 01:45:36,931
Holding at mid-altitude orbit, 12,500...

1318
01:45:46,352 --> 01:45:48,272
<i>Still holding for vector angle.</i>

1319
01:45:59,432 --> 01:46:02,282
- Still holding for vector angle.
- Switching over to SAR.

1320
01:46:24,824 --> 01:46:26,621
Which one do you want us to follow?

1321
01:46:30,963 --> 01:46:32,430
Which one, sir?

1322
01:46:33,733 --> 01:46:35,826
<i>Sir?</i>

1323
01:46:36,002 --> 01:46:37,993
Sorry, buddy.

1324
01:48:07,627 --> 01:48:11,028
Salaam, CIA.

1325
01:48:15,401 --> 01:48:16,891
I am not the sheik.

1326
01:48:17,069 --> 01:48:20,436
The sheik, God praise him,
is the sheik who always was.

1327
01:48:20,606 --> 01:48:22,403
I am his servant.

1328
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:26,540
Where is the girl?

1329
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:29,132
Either you're trying to be clever...

1330
01:48:29,215 --> 01:48:33,345
...or someone has done to you
what you so often do to them.

1331
01:48:33,519 --> 01:48:35,350
Lie.

1332
01:48:36,088 --> 01:48:38,420
So you paid for me? Hm?

1333
01:48:38,591 --> 01:48:40,218
Not as much as I would have.

1334
01:48:40,827 --> 01:48:44,126
Such a bargain for such a catch as you.

1335
01:48:44,297 --> 01:48:48,734
Well, it wasn't a bargain, because
no one's gonna negotiate with you for me.

1336
01:48:48,901 --> 01:48:52,751
That's not our policy. There will be
no exchanges. You understand that, right?

1337
01:48:52,839 --> 01:48:56,468
There will be no negotiation,
but not because you say so.

1338
01:48:57,276 --> 01:48:59,972
I have an agent of the CIA.

1339
01:49:00,546 --> 01:49:04,983
And that's what I came to see.
And that's what matters.

1340
01:49:06,385 --> 01:49:07,647
In this world...

1341
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:12,917
...there's enough poverty and frustration
and anger and passion.

1342
01:49:13,092 --> 01:49:15,856
There will never be a shortage of martyrs.

1343
01:49:16,629 --> 01:49:20,258
Just like these men, huh?
These men who are dispensable to you.

1344
01:49:20,433 --> 01:49:23,834
These men who blow themselves up
in the name of Allah...

1345
01:49:24,003 --> 01:49:26,528
...who kill their own
brothers and sisters, huh?

1346
01:49:26,706 --> 01:49:30,699
There is no place in the Koran for
the murder of innocent people and suicide.

1347
01:49:30,877 --> 01:49:33,004
- You know that.
- It's a good try.

1348
01:49:33,446 --> 01:49:38,110
But the Koran's sayings...
You speak Arabic, no?

1349
01:49:48,694 --> 01:49:52,630
So you misinterpret the one book
you believe in, hm?

1350
01:49:53,065 --> 01:49:54,657
But are you pure...

1351
01:49:54,834 --> 01:49:59,271
...or are you just as corrupt as the
capitalist Westerners that you despise?

1352
01:49:59,438 --> 01:50:01,531
To me, you are fucking slaves.

1353
01:50:01,707 --> 01:50:05,768
You're slaves to the Saudi oil sheiks
and the Wahabi oil money that funds you.

1354
01:50:05,945 --> 01:50:08,164
And when that oil money runs out,
my friends...

1355
01:50:08,247 --> 01:50:12,377
...you will all fucking disappear
into the ashes of history.

1356
01:50:12,551 --> 01:50:15,611
I am not going to torture you,
Mr. Ferris.

1357
01:50:15,788 --> 01:50:20,054
I see you're not going to read
what is prepared for you on paper.

1358
01:50:20,226 --> 01:50:21,250
It's all right.

1359
01:50:21,994 --> 01:50:25,760
All I need from you, I already have.

1360
01:50:25,932 --> 01:50:28,457
You know what that camera is for?

1361
01:50:29,035 --> 01:50:32,596
It's not for this. This...
This is intermission.

1362
01:50:33,272 --> 01:50:39,074
It's for what comes after this.
For what comes now.

1363
01:50:48,587 --> 01:50:50,020
Kareem.

1364
01:50:50,923 --> 01:50:52,914
But you paid who for me?

1365
01:50:53,092 --> 01:50:55,788
An intermediary who works for who?

1366
01:50:55,962 --> 01:50:58,522
You don't know who
and that should concern you.

1367
01:50:58,698 --> 01:51:01,758
- Do I look concerned?
- Well, that's what surprises me.

1368
01:51:01,934 --> 01:51:04,198
I thought you were
a lot smarter than that.

1369
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:08,465
Someone has betrayed you.

1370
01:51:08,641 --> 01:51:11,091
He works for the head
of Jordanian Intelligence...

1371
01:51:11,243 --> 01:51:13,006
...which means he
works for us...

1372
01:51:13,179 --> 01:51:19,209
...which means...
Which means you work for us.

1373
01:51:21,354 --> 01:51:24,482
I work for you.

1374
01:51:35,601 --> 01:51:36,659
Are you comfortable?

1375
01:51:37,370 --> 01:51:39,235
Can I make you...

1376
01:51:39,405 --> 01:51:41,805
...more comfortable?

1377
01:51:47,947 --> 01:51:50,745
I'm not lying to you, Kareem.
I'm not lying to you.

1378
01:51:51,784 --> 01:51:55,413
We know...
We know where you are!

1379
01:51:56,689 --> 01:51:58,714
Where am I?

1380
01:51:58,891 --> 01:52:01,860
You... You...
You are in the light.

1381
01:52:02,028 --> 01:52:04,929
The light is on you.
Look at it.

1382
01:52:05,998 --> 01:52:07,829
No, no, no.

1383
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,697
The light...
The light is on you, motherfucker.

1384
01:52:17,009 --> 01:52:19,500
What do you think is happening here,
Mr. Ferris?

1385
01:52:19,678 --> 01:52:22,146
Do you think the cavalry
is coming for you?

1386
01:52:23,282 --> 01:52:25,045
Let's wait.

1387
01:52:27,153 --> 01:52:29,747
Nobody's coming for you.

1388
01:52:29,922 --> 01:52:32,015
Welcome to Guantanamo.

1389
01:52:34,994 --> 01:52:37,224
God! Fuck!

1390
01:55:31,103 --> 01:55:33,189
You can tell who cares
about you the most...

1391
01:55:33,272 --> 01:55:36,173
...by who comes first
to visit you in the hospital.

1392
01:55:36,342 --> 01:55:38,902
And I believe I am the first.

1393
01:55:39,078 --> 01:55:41,831
That is not difficult,
because nobody knows where you are.

1394
01:55:41,914 --> 01:55:43,472
Yeah.

1395
01:55:43,649 --> 01:55:45,640
And where am I, Hani?

1396
01:55:45,818 --> 01:55:47,877
You're home, in Amman.

1397
01:55:50,389 --> 01:55:55,224
So it was your man I spoke to
on the phone...

1398
01:55:56,128 --> 01:55:59,154
...your men who took Aisha...

1399
01:55:59,331 --> 01:56:02,027
...your men who dropped me off
in the desert.

1400
01:56:02,201 --> 01:56:05,227
I was of some assistance, I admit.

1401
01:56:05,404 --> 01:56:09,170
But it was not me
that picked you up in the desert.

1402
01:56:09,341 --> 01:56:10,865
Edward could not find you.

1403
01:56:11,443 --> 01:56:15,038
Not with all his aircraft, all his people,
all his money...

1404
01:56:15,214 --> 01:56:17,842
...and joie de vivre.

1405
01:56:18,017 --> 01:56:20,247
So how, I wonder, did I do it?

1406
01:56:20,419 --> 01:56:23,877
- Karami.
- Very good. You remember him?

1407
01:56:24,056 --> 01:56:28,618
Yes, I remember him, Hani.
He was in the fucking room with me.

1408
01:56:28,794 --> 01:56:32,594
He was in the room
because I put him there.

1409
01:56:32,765 --> 01:56:35,265
I'm just sorry
I wasn't there a few minutes sooner.

1410
01:56:35,367 --> 01:56:38,859
Right. What would've happened
if you were a few minutes later, Hani?

1411
01:56:39,038 --> 01:56:41,734
- Then I shudder to think.
- No, I shudder to think.

1412
01:56:43,676 --> 01:56:47,077
How badly did you hurt Aisha
when you took her, huh?

1413
01:56:47,246 --> 01:56:49,771
- That's what I wanna know.
- Aisha, not at all.

1414
01:56:50,949 --> 01:56:53,543
The room we messed up after we took her.

1415
01:56:53,719 --> 01:56:55,448
Bullshit, Hani, bullshit!

1416
01:56:55,621 --> 01:56:58,590
All right. We tested that
blood! All right? It was hers!

1417
01:56:58,757 --> 01:57:01,385
She is a nurse.
She gives blood every month.

1418
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:04,085
Now, please, let go of the jacket.
Thank you.

1419
01:57:06,231 --> 01:57:09,598
You're trying to tell me
you didn't tell her, Hani?

1420
01:57:09,768 --> 01:57:12,999
I told her what I could,
which I admit was not very much...

1421
01:57:13,172 --> 01:57:15,572
...because these are matters
of state security.

1422
01:57:15,741 --> 01:57:18,094
So she doesn't know anything
about what happened?

1423
01:57:18,177 --> 01:57:21,169
She knows what everybody
who knows me knows.

1424
01:57:21,347 --> 01:57:25,374
That I am an exceedingly polite gentleman
and a very good conversationalist.

1425
01:57:25,551 --> 01:57:27,018
Huh.

1426
01:57:27,820 --> 01:57:30,789
If I may be so fucking impolite, Hani...

1427
01:57:30,956 --> 01:57:33,584
...I almost died in
that goddamn room.

1428
01:57:33,759 --> 01:57:37,388
And if you had died, I would
have told her what you did for her.

1429
01:57:37,563 --> 01:57:41,761
And she...
She would have loved you forever.

1430
01:57:42,434 --> 01:57:45,801
Whereas now you are going
to have to earn that right.

1431
01:57:46,472 --> 01:57:48,963
That's great news.

1432
01:57:51,443 --> 01:57:53,468
Fantastic work, Hani.

1433
01:57:53,645 --> 01:57:55,670
Really. Excellent.

1434
01:57:56,682 --> 01:57:58,843
So you now have Al-Saleem, right?

1435
01:57:59,685 --> 01:58:01,550
That was the plan, my dear.

1436
01:58:03,355 --> 01:58:07,052
And I presume he's not giving you
any information.

1437
01:58:07,226 --> 01:58:08,784
Not yet.

1438
01:58:20,773 --> 01:58:22,900
Your work's done here, buddy.

1439
01:58:23,342 --> 01:58:25,828
You're gonna come back.
I got you a corner office...

1440
01:58:25,911 --> 01:58:28,038
...just down the hall from mine.

1441
01:58:28,213 --> 01:58:31,478
As soon as I get the guy who's in it
out of it, it's all yours.

1442
01:58:31,650 --> 01:58:33,880
More money, a fancy title.

1443
01:58:34,052 --> 01:58:37,852
No sunscreen, no couscous,
unless you really want it.

1444
01:58:38,023 --> 01:58:41,754
- Right down the hall from you, huh, Ed?
- Right down the hall from me.

1445
01:58:41,927 --> 01:58:46,023
Well, I think we both know you'd be
more comfortable without me there.

1446
01:58:46,765 --> 01:58:49,785
Now, don't think about it too long,
because I'll take that as a slight.

1447
01:58:49,868 --> 01:58:51,267
Hm.

1448
01:58:51,437 --> 01:58:55,999
Besides, what else are you gonna do?
Stay here?

1449
01:58:56,175 --> 01:58:59,201
Maybe for a little while, huh?
I mean, why wouldn't I?

1450
01:58:59,378 --> 01:59:01,403
Why would you?

1451
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,739
What if I like the Middle East?

1452
01:59:05,284 --> 01:59:09,084
Ain't nobody likes the Middle East, buddy.
There's nothing here to like.

1453
01:59:09,555 --> 01:59:11,113
Hmm.

1454
01:59:11,523 --> 01:59:14,617
Well, maybe that's the
problem right there, isn't it, Ed?

1455
01:59:16,128 --> 01:59:17,493
Hm.

1456
01:59:17,830 --> 01:59:19,855
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy.

1457
01:59:20,032 --> 01:59:24,196
You know, you're the best I got.

1458
01:59:24,369 --> 01:59:26,219
And you know it hurts me to say that.

1459
01:59:29,107 --> 01:59:32,167
Good luck on winning this war, Ed.

1460
01:59:32,344 --> 01:59:36,075
I hope everyone thinks
you did it all by yourself, huh?

1461
01:59:41,386 --> 01:59:43,286
You're not safe here.

1462
01:59:43,455 --> 01:59:45,218
I'm not safe anywhere.

1463
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:47,576
You walk out on me,
you know what that means.

1464
01:59:47,659 --> 01:59:49,559
What does that mean?

1465
01:59:50,629 --> 01:59:52,579
That means you're giving up on America.

1466
01:59:53,232 --> 01:59:56,827
Just be careful calling yourself
America, huh, Ed?

1467
01:59:57,703 --> 02:00:02,367
Listen, you have a safe flight home.
Say hey to the wife and kids.

1468
02:00:02,541 --> 02:00:04,941
Nobody's innocent in this shit, Ferris.

1469
02:01:24,923 --> 02:01:25,947
<i>What's he doing?</i>

1470
02:01:26,124 --> 02:01:27,853
<i>Nothing. Buying vegetables.</i>

1471
02:01:28,994 --> 02:01:31,895
<i>What about us, sir?
What do you want us to do?</i>

1472
02:01:32,064 --> 02:01:33,656
<i>Are we staying with him?</i>

1473
02:01:33,832 --> 02:01:36,699
No. Buddy's done.

1474
02:01:36,868 --> 02:01:38,426
He's all by himself.

1475
02:01:38,604 --> 02:01:41,971
<i>Copy that. Cleared off target.</i>

1
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,270
Watch that line, now.
Watch that line.

2
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,857
<i>- Po Lazarus
- Po Lazarus!</i>

3
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:57,943
<i>Po Lazarus...</i>

4
00:00:58,194 --> 00:01:03,366
<i>Well, the high sheriff, he told the deputy</i>

5
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:10,623
<i>Won't you go out and bring me Lazarus?</i>

6
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:16,712
<i>Well, the high sheriff, he told the deputy</i>

7
00:01:16,962 --> 00:01:23,969
<i>Won't you go out and bring me Lazarus?</i>

8
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:28,391
<i>Oh, bring him dead or alive</i>

9
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,309
<i>O Lord</i>

10
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:35,147
<i>Bring him dead or alive</i>

11
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:41,153
<i>Well, the deputy, he told the high sheriff</i>

12
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,244
<i>Well, I ain't gonna mess with Lazarus</i>

13
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:53,416
<i>Well, the deputy, he told the high sheriff</i>

14
00:01:53,666 --> 00:02:00,172
<i>Said I ain't gonna mess with Lazarus...</i>

15
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:05,094
- Pick up that hammer, boy.
- Yes, sir, boss.

16
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:08,848
<i>Well, he's a dangerous man</i>

17
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:16,188
<i>O Lord, he's a dangerous man...</i>

18
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:21,027
Go on, hit it! Go!

19
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,081
<i>One evening as the sun went down</i>

20
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:36,709
<i>And the jungle fire was burning</i>

21
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:39,378
<i>Down the track came a hobo hikin'</i>

22
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:42,048
<i>And he said, boys, I'm not turning</i>

23
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:45,051
<i>I'm headed for a land that's far away</i>

24
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:47,553
<i>Beside the crystal fountains</i>

25
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:52,642
<i>So come with me, we'll go and see
the big rock candy mountains</i>

26
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:55,394
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

27
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:58,064
<i>There's a land that's fair and bright</i>

28
00:02:58,314 --> 00:03:00,566
<i>Where the handouts grow on bushes</i>

29
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:03,402
<i>And you sleep out every night</i>

30
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,988
<i>Where the boxcars all are empty</i>

31
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:07,907
<i>And the sun shines every day</i>

32
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:11,410
<i>On the birds and the bees
and the cigarette trees</i>

33
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,830
<i>The lemonade springs
where the bluebird sings</i>

34
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:17,583
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

35
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,086
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

36
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:22,672
<i>All the cops have wooden legs</i>

37
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:25,424
<i>And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth</i>

38
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:28,010
<i>And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs</i>

39
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:30,513
<i>The farmers' trees are full of fruit</i>

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,015
<i>And the barns are full of hay</i>

41
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:35,434
<i>Oh, I'm bound to go
where there ain't no snow</i>

42
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:37,937
<i>Where the rain don't fall,
the wind don't blow</i>

43
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:41,691
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

44
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:44,276
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

45
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,529
<i>You never change your socks</i>

46
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:49,198
<i>And the little streams of alcohol</i>

47
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:51,534
<i>Come a-trickling down the rocks</i>

48
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,036
<i>The brakemen have to tip their hats</i>

49
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:56,455
<i>And the railroad bulls are blind</i>

50
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:59,041
<i>There's a lake of stew and of whiskey, too</i>

51
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,525
<i>You can paddle all around 'em
in a big canoe</i>

52
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:05,548
<i>In the big rock candy mountains...</i>

53
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:10,136
<i>The jails are made of tin</i>

54
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:12,388
<i>And you can walk right out again</i>

55
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:15,057
<i>As soon as you are in</i>

56
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:17,310
<i>There ain't no short-handle shovels</i>

57
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:19,812
<i>No axes, saws or picks</i>

58
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:22,398
<i>I'm a-goin' to stay
where you sleep all day</i>

59
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:24,734
<i>Where they hung the jerk
that invented work</i>

60
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:28,821
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

61
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,746
<i>I'll see you all this comin' fall</i>

62
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:40,958
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

63
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:18,204
Say,

64
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:21,957
any of you boys smithies?

65
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,629
Or if not smithies,
trained in the metallurgic arts,

66
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:31,759
before circumstances forced you
into a life of wanderin'?

67
00:05:40,977 --> 00:05:43,896
Jesus! Can't I count on you people?

68
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,815
Sorry, Everett.

69
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:50,820
Well, all right.
If we take off through that bayou...

70
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,405
Wait a minute!

71
00:05:52,655 --> 00:05:55,157
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

72
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:59,328
I figured it should be the one with
the capacity for abstract thought,

73
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:02,665
but if that ain't the consensus,
then hell, let's vote.

74
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:05,334
Suits me!
I'm votin' for yours truly.

75
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:09,505
Well, I'm votin' for yours truly, too.

76
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:16,262
OK. I'm with you fellas.

77
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:43,289
Mind if we join you, old-timer?

78
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,711
Join me, m'son. Join me.

79
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,132
You work for the railroad, grandpa?

80
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:55,635
I work for no man.

81
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:59,889
- Got a name, do you?
- I have no name.

82
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:04,393
That may be why you had difficulty
finding gainful employment.

83
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,480
Y'see, in the mart
of competitive commerce...

84
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,565
You seek a great fortune,

85
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:12,318
you three who are now in chains.

86
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:15,237
You will find a fortune,

87
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:18,824
though it will not be
the fortune you seek.

88
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:21,243
But first...

89
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:27,333
first you must travel
a long and difficult road,

90
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:32,338
a road fraught with peril, mm-hmm.

91
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:35,675
You shall see things...

92
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:38,010
wonderful to tell.

93
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,681
You shall see a... a cow...

94
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:46,519
on the roof of a cotton house, ha.

95
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:51,107
And, oh, so many startlements.

96
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:54,443
I cannot tell you how long
this road shall be,

97
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,863
but fear not the obstacles in your path,

98
00:07:58,197 --> 00:07:59,448
for fate has...

99
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,868
vouchsafed your reward.

100
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:05,871
Though the road may wind,

101
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:08,708
yea, your hearts grow weary,

102
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:11,711
still shall ye follow them,

103
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:16,799
even unto your salvation.

104
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:32,481
No, the treasure's
still there, believe me.

105
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:35,067
But how'd he know about it?

106
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:39,238
I don't know, Delmar. The blind
reputedly possess sensitivities

107
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:41,324
compensating for lack of sight,

108
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:44,243
to the point of developing psychic powers.

109
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:47,997
Clearly, seeing the future
falls into that category.

110
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:52,251
It's not so surprising, then,
that one lacking earthly vision...

111
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:55,504
He said we wouldn't get
the treasure we seek,

112
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,423
on account of our obstacles.

113
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,426
What the hell
does an ignorant old man know?

114
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:03,429
Jesus, Pete. I told you
I buried it myself.

115
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,765
If your cousin still has this farm

116
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:09,310
and shoein' impedimenta
to restore liberty of movement...

117
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,521
Hold it right there!

118
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:16,484
You men from the bank?

119
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:18,277
You Wash's boy?

120
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:22,198
Yes, sir. Daddy told me to shoot
who's ever from the bank.

121
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:24,950
We ain't from the bank, young fella.

122
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:28,537
Yes, sir. I'm supposed to shoot folks
servin' papers.

123
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:32,416
- We ain't got no papers, neither.
- I nicked the census man.

124
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,794
Now, there's a good boy.

125
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:37,213
Is... is your daddy about?

126
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:51,394
Hello, Pete.

127
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:53,729
Who are your friends?

128
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:56,816
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, Mr Hogwallop.

129
00:09:57,066 --> 00:10:02,237
- My name's Ulysses Everett McGill...
- I'm Delmar O'Donnel.

130
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:04,156
How you been, Wash?

131
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:07,243
Been what, 12, 13 years?

132
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:12,248
Yeah...

133
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:16,210
I expect you want them chains knocked off.

134
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:19,171
They foreclosed on cousin Bishop.

135
00:10:19,422 --> 00:10:22,300
He hanged hisself a year come May.

136
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:24,385
And Uncle Radcliffe?

137
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,846
The anthrax took most of his cows.

138
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:28,723
The rest don't milk.

139
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:31,767
He lost a boy to mumps.

140
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:35,855
Where's Cora, Cousin Wash?

141
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:42,528
Couldn't say.

142
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:48,868
Mrs Hogwallop up and R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

143
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:52,204
She must have been lookin' for answers.

144
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:55,708
Possibly. Good riddance,
as far as I'm concerned.

145
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,878
I do miss her cooking, though.

146
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:02,965
- This stew's awful good.
- Think so?

147
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:05,885
I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday.

148
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:10,723
I'm afraid she's startin' to turn.

149
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:16,979
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

150
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:20,149
<i>My only sunshine</i>

151
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:22,151
<i>You make me happy</i>

152
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:24,737
<i>When skies are grey</i>

153
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:27,406
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

154
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,242
<i>How much I love you</i>

155
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:35,247
<i>Please don't take my sunshine away</i>

156
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:40,586
<i>That winds up the Pass The
Biscuits Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour.</i>

157
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:42,171
<i>This is Pappy O'Daniel</i>

158
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:45,257
<i>hopin' you been enjoyin'
that old-timey music.</i>

159
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:47,426
<i>And remember,</i>

160
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:51,097
<i>when you're fixing to
bake a mess of biscuits,</i>

161
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,182
<i>use cool, clear water</i>

162
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:57,603
<i>and good, pure, Pappy O'Daniel flour.</i>

163
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:03,109
Well, guess I'll be turnin' in.
Say, uh, cousin Wash,

164
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,528
I suppose it'd be the acme of foolishness

165
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:07,613
to ask if you had a hair net.

166
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:10,616
We got a bunch in yon bureau.

167
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:13,202
Mrs Hogwallop's, matter of fact.

168
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:18,040
Help yourself.
I won't be needing 'em.

169
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:19,875
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

170
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:23,462
<i>My only sunshine</i>

171
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:26,132
<i>You make me happy</i>

172
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:27,883
<i>When skies are grey...</i>

173
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:30,303
All right, boys!

174
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:33,472
How's my hair?

175
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:38,060
It's the authorities!
We got you surrounded.

176
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:40,229
Damn, we're in a tight spot.

177
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:43,482
Just come on out and grab at air!

178
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,152
And don't try nothin' fancy.

179
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:48,904
Your situation is pretty nigh hopeless.

180
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:52,825
- Damn! We're in a tight spot!
- What in the Sam Hill...?

181
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:54,827
Pete's cousin turned us in.

182
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:56,412
What the hell you sayin'?!

183
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:58,247
Wash is kin!

184
00:12:58,497 --> 00:12:59,582
Sorry, Pete!

185
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:03,502
I know we're kin,
but they got this depression on.

186
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:05,421
I got to do for me and mine.

187
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:09,925
I'm gonna kill you,
Judas Iscariot Hogwallop!

188
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,513
You miserable, horse-eatin' son of a...

189
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:16,432
Damn! We're in a tight spot!

190
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:18,267
Damn his eyes!

191
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:22,355
Pa always said, "Never trust a Hogwallop".

192
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:25,024
Come and get us, coppers!

193
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:30,196
You leave us no choice
but to smoke you out.

194
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:32,114
We're in a tight spot.

195
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,366
Light her up!

196
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:36,952
Hold up!
Ain't you ever heard of negotiatin'?

197
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:39,538
We could talk this thing out.
I hate fire!

198
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:44,543
You lousy, yella-bellied...
Pete, we need one voice.

199
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:48,381
Careful with that fire!

200
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:51,050
Light the loft, son.

201
00:13:51,217 --> 00:13:53,552
Aah! I hate fire!

202
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:57,890
Gapped-toothed, carpetbaggin',
motherless spawn of hell!

203
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,893
Step back. Damn it. Look out.

204
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:02,895
Holy Saint Christopher!

205
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:05,648
Get away from that, she's liquid fire!

206
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:11,487
Take cover, boys! It ain't popcorn!

207
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:24,083
Scatter, boys!

208
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:28,170
God damn it!

209
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:32,508
Get in, boys!

210
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:35,261
I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-T!

211
00:14:35,428 --> 00:14:39,181
Come on, boys, come on! Come on!

212
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:43,602
What are you doing here? You ought
to be in bed, clump snatcher.

213
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:46,939
You ain't the boss of me!

214
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:57,033
You candy-butted,
car-thievin' sos-and-sos!

215
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,285
I curse your name!

216
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:02,371
Go back home and mind your pa!

217
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,629
What's the damn problem?

218
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,799
I can get the part from Bristol
in two weeks. Your pomade.

219
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,969
Two weeks?
That don't do me no good.

220
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:19,639
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

221
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:23,225
Hold on. I don't want this pomade,
I want Dapper Dan.

222
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:26,312
I don't carry Dapper Dan.
I carry Fop.

223
00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:30,066
I don't want Fop, god damn it!
I'm a Dapper Dan man!

224
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:32,902
Watch your language,
this is a public market.

225
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:37,573
Now, if you want Dapper Dan,
I can have it in a coupla weeks.

226
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:41,327
Ain't this a geographical oddity!
Two weeks from everywhere.

227
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:43,412
Forget it.

228
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:47,500
Just a dozen hair nets.

229
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,419
Well, didn't look like a one-horse town,

230
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:53,005
but try finding a decent hair jelly.

231
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:57,426
- Gopher, Everett?
- No transmission belt for two weeks.

232
00:15:57,593 --> 00:16:00,346
Huh? They dam that river on the 21st.

233
00:16:00,513 --> 00:16:02,932
- Today is the 17th.
- Don't I know it.

234
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:05,768
We got but four days
to get to that treasure.

235
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:08,854
After that, it'll be
at the bottom of a lake.

236
00:16:09,105 --> 00:16:10,940
We won't make it walkin'.

237
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,275
- Right...
- Gopher?

238
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:15,778
But the old tactician's got a plan.

239
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:19,949
For the transportation,
not keeping my coiffure in order.

240
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:23,285
How's this a plan?
How we gonna get a car?

241
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:27,957
Sell that. I figure you can only have
painful association for Wash.

242
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,712
"To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop,

243
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:34,380
from his lovin' Cora."

244
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:40,052
- "Amor fidel... is."
- It was in his bureau,

245
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:43,556
I reckon it'll fetch us enough
for a good auto voiture

246
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:45,558
and a little leftover besides.

247
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:48,311
Whoo! You got light fingers, Everett.

248
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:52,231
- Gopher?
- You miserable little snake.

249
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,317
You stole from my kin!

250
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:57,069
Who was fixin' to betray us.

251
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,322
You didn't know that at the time.

252
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,657
So I borrowed it till I did know.

253
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,826
That don't make no sense!

254
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:06,829
A fool seeks logic
in the chambers of the heart.

255
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:11,667
What the hell is that singing?

256
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:18,758
Appears to be some kind
of a... congregation.

257
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:22,595
Care for some gopher?

258
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,265
No, thank you, Delmar.

259
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:29,352
A third of a gopher'd
only arouse my appetite

260
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:31,937
without beddin' her back down.

261
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:34,440
Oh, you can have the whole thing.

262
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:37,610
Me and Pete already had one.

263
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:44,950
We ran across
a whole... gopher... village.

264
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:53,042
<i>O brothers, let's go down</i>

265
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:56,963
<i>Let's go down, come on down</i>

266
00:17:57,338 --> 00:18:00,633
<i>Come on, brothers, let's go down</i>

267
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:05,012
<i>Down in the river to pray</i>

268
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:09,058
<i>As I went down in the river to pray</i>

269
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:12,186
<i>Studyin' about that good old way</i>

270
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:15,898
<i>And who shall wear the starry crown</i>

271
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:20,486
<i>Good Lord, show me the way</i>

272
00:18:20,653 --> 00:18:24,240
<i>O fathers, let's go down</i>

273
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,077
<i>Let's go down, come on down</i>

274
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:31,622
<i>O fathers, let's go down</i>

275
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:36,085
<i>Down in the river to pray</i>

276
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,256
<i>As I went down in the river to pray</i>

277
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:43,592
<i>Studying about that good old way</i>

278
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:47,179
<i>And who shall wear the robe and crown</i>

279
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:52,018
<i>Good lord, show me the way</i>

280
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:55,730
<i>O mothers, let's go down</i>

281
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:59,233
<i>Come on down, don't you wanna go down?</i>

282
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:03,195
<i>Come on, mothers, let's go down...</i>

283
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:06,532
Well, I guess hard times flush the chumps.

284
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:08,868
Everybody's lookin' for answers.

285
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:14,498
Where the hell's he going?

286
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:18,669
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

287
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,840
<i>Good Lord, show me the way</i>

288
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:27,470
<i>O sinners, let's go down...</i>

289
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:30,139
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

290
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:32,308
Delmar's been saved.

291
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,561
Well, that's it, boys.
I been redeemed.

292
00:19:35,728 --> 00:19:39,982
The preacher done washed away
all my sins and transgressions.

293
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:43,027
It's the straight and narrow
from here on out.

294
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,821
And heaven everlasting's my reward.

295
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,283
Delmar, what are you on about?
We got bigger fish to fry.

296
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:52,495
The preacher said
all my sins is washed away,

297
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:55,748
including that Piggly Wiggly
I knocked over in Yazoo.

298
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:58,084
You said you was innocent of that.

299
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:00,586
Well, I was lyin'.

300
00:20:00,753 --> 00:20:04,548
And the preacher said that
that sin's been washed away, too.

301
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:08,052
Neither God nor man's
got nothin' on me now.

302
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:13,265
Come on in, boys.
The water is fine.

303
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:22,024
Come on, boy.
There, boy. Good doggy.

304
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:28,406
All right, boys, we got the scent.

305
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:34,787
- The preacher said it absolved us.
- For Him, not for the law.

306
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:37,707
I gave you credit for
more brains than Delmar.

307
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:41,961
- But witnesses seen us redeemed.
- That's not the issue, Delmar.

308
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:45,464
Even square with the Lord,
Mississippi's hard-nosed.

309
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:49,135
You shoulda joined us, Everett.
It couldn'a hurt none.

310
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:52,763
Hell, it woulda washed away
the stink of that pomade.

311
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:56,684
Joining you fools in superstition?
Thank you, anyway.

312
00:20:56,934 --> 00:21:02,273
And I like the smell of my hair,
the pleasin' odour's half the point.

313
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:04,483
Baptism!

314
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,986
You two are dumber than a bag of hammers.

315
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,196
You're my cross to bear.

316
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:14,285
Pull over, Everett. Let's give
that coloured boy a lift.

317
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:22,627
You folks going past Tishomingo?

318
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:25,755
Sure, hop in.

319
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:35,014
How you doin', son? Name's Everett.

320
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:38,643
These two soggy sons of bitches
are Pete and Delmar.

321
00:21:39,018 --> 00:21:42,772
Keep your fingers away from Pete's
mouth, he ain't eaten for 13 years,

322
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:45,274
'cept prison food and greasy horse.

323
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:49,445
Thanks for the lift, sir.
My name's Tommy. Tommy Johnson.

324
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:51,614
How you doin', Tommy?

325
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:54,867
Say, I haven't seen a house
out here for miles.

326
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:57,620
Why are you out in the middle of nowhere?

327
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,539
I had to be at that crossroads
last midnight.

328
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:02,750
Sell my soul to the devil.

329
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,503
Ain't it a small world,
spiritually speakin'?

330
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:09,882
Pete and Delmar just been saved.
I'm the only one still unaffiliated.

331
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:12,218
It's no laughin' matter.

332
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,303
What'd the devil give you for it?

333
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:18,015
Well, he taught me to play
this here guitar real good.

334
00:22:18,224 --> 00:22:22,436
Oh, son, for that you traded
your everlasting soul?

335
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:24,271
Well, I wasn't usin' it.

336
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,651
I've always wondered,
what's the devil look like?

337
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:32,405
Well, there are all manner
of lesser imps and demons,

338
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:36,242
but Satan hisself is red and scaly
with a bifurcated tail,

339
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:39,996
- and he carries a hayfork.
- Oh, no. No, sir.

340
00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:43,666
He's white.
As white as you folks.

341
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,752
With empty eyes and a big, hollow voice.

342
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:50,756
He travelled around
with a mean old hound, that's right.

343
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:52,925
He told you to go to Tishomingo?

344
00:22:53,092 --> 00:22:55,928
Well, no, sir.
Why, that was my idea.

345
00:22:56,262 --> 00:22:58,014
I heard there's a man there,

346
00:22:58,347 --> 00:23:00,599
pays folks money to sing into his can.

347
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:04,770
They say he pays extra
if'n you play real good.

348
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:06,856
Tishomingo, huh?

349
00:23:07,106 --> 00:23:08,691
How much he pay?

350
00:23:25,124 --> 00:23:29,795
All right, boys, follow my lead.

351
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:36,302
Hello?

352
00:23:36,636 --> 00:23:41,223
- Who's the honcho here?
- I am. Who are you?

353
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,895
Well, sir, I'm Jordan Rivers,
and these are the Soggy Bottom Boys,

354
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:48,064
out of Cottonillia, Mississippi.

355
00:23:48,314 --> 00:23:50,650
Songs of salvation to salve the soul.

356
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:54,737
Uh, we hear that you pay good money
to sing into a can.

357
00:23:54,987 --> 00:23:58,324
Well, that all depends.
You boys do Negro songs?

358
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:03,412
Um... Well, uh, sir, we are Negroes.

359
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:07,667
All except for our accomp... accomp...
the fella that plays the guitar.

360
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:10,086
Yeah, well, I don't record Negro songs.

361
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:13,756
No, I'm lookin' for
some old-timey material.

362
00:24:14,006 --> 00:24:16,008
People can't seem to get enough

363
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:19,679
since we started broadcasting it
on the Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour,

364
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:22,181
so thank you for stopping by, but...

365
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:27,269
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys have been
steeped in old-timey material.

366
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,189
- Heck, we're silly with it.
- That's right.

367
00:24:30,523 --> 00:24:32,525
Right. We ain't really Negroes.

368
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,860
All except for our accompanist.

369
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,784
<i>I am a man</i>

370
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:44,787
<i>Of constant sorrow</i>

371
00:24:45,037 --> 00:24:51,043
<i>I've seen trouble all my days</i>

372
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:55,631
<i>I bid farewell</i>

373
00:24:55,965 --> 00:24:58,467
<i>To old Kentucky</i>

374
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:01,053
<i>The place where I</i>

375
00:25:01,304 --> 00:25:03,973
<i>Was born and raised</i>

376
00:25:04,223 --> 00:25:06,976
<i>The place where he</i>

377
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,646
<i>Was born and raised</i>

378
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:15,234
<i>For six long years</i>

379
00:25:15,568 --> 00:25:18,070
<i>I've been in trouble</i>

380
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:20,990
<i>No pleasure here</i>

381
00:25:21,324 --> 00:25:24,660
<i>On Earth I found</i>

382
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:29,081
<i>For in this world</i>

383
00:25:29,332 --> 00:25:31,500
<i>I'm bound to ramble</i>

384
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:34,754
<i>I have no friends</i>

385
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,590
<i>To help me now</i>

386
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,343
<i>He has no friends</i>

387
00:25:40,676 --> 00:25:44,096
<i>To help him now</i>

388
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:48,851
<i>Maybe your friends think</i>

389
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:51,604
<i>I'm just a stranger</i>

390
00:25:51,937 --> 00:25:54,357
<i>My face you never</i>

391
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,941
<i>Will see no more</i>

392
00:25:58,444 --> 00:26:03,199
<i>But there is one promise</i>

393
00:26:03,532 --> 00:26:05,534
<i>That is given</i>

394
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:08,287
<i>I'll meet you on</i>

395
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:11,123
<i>God's golden shore</i>

396
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:14,043
<i>He'll meet you on</i>

397
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:19,298
<i>God's golden shore</i>

398
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:24,136
Whoo! Hot damn, son!
You did sell your soul to the devil!

399
00:26:25,972 --> 00:26:29,809
Boy, that was some mighty fine
a-pickin' and a-singin'.

400
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:31,394
I'll tell you what.

401
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,896
Ahem. You come on
in here, you...

402
00:26:34,063 --> 00:26:38,567
you sign these papers here,
I'm gonna give you $10 apiece.

403
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:44,991
Uh, OK, sir, but Mert and...
Aloysious'll have to sign x's.

404
00:26:45,324 --> 00:26:49,328
- Only four of us can write.
- That'd be fine.

405
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:55,584
Hey, mister, I don't mean
to tell tales out of school,

406
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:59,588
but there's a fella in there'll pay
you $10 if you sing into his can.

407
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:02,925
I'm not hear to make a record,
you dumb cracker.

408
00:27:03,175 --> 00:27:05,011
They broadcast me on the radio.

409
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:08,180
That's Governor Menelaus "Pappy" O'Daniel.

410
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:12,518
He'd sure like it if you ate his
farina and voted him a second term.

411
00:27:12,852 --> 00:27:15,438
- Finest in Mississippi.
- In any state.

412
00:27:15,771 --> 00:27:17,940
Lord, yes. Every parish.

413
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,027
Ain't you gonna press the flesh, Pappy?

414
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:24,447
I'll press your flesh,
you dim-witted son'bitch.

415
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:28,534
Don't tell me how to court the
electorate. We ain't one-at-a-timin'.

416
00:27:28,784 --> 00:27:30,453
We're mass communicatin'!

417
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:33,289
Oh, yes, that's a powerful new force.

418
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:34,957
Shake a leg, Junior.

419
00:27:35,207 --> 00:27:37,543
Thank God your mammy died givin' birth,

420
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:39,378
she'd have died of shame.

421
00:27:39,545 --> 00:27:41,547
Well, hi there! How you doin'?

422
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:49,138
<i>Hard time yearnin' where you go</i>

423
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:54,977
<i>Times is harder than ever been before</i>

424
00:28:00,232 --> 00:28:03,319
<i>And the people are driftin'</i>

425
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:06,072
<i>From door to door</i>

426
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:07,740
<i>Can't find no heaven</i>

427
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:11,243
<i>I don't care where they go</i>

428
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:24,423
<i>Say you had money</i>

429
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,093
<i>You better be sure</i>

430
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:29,178
<i>These hard times will drive you</i>

431
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:32,348
<i>From door to door</i>

432
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,529
Let's bed down here for the night.

433
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:50,366
Yeah, it stinks in that old barn.

434
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,034
Suits me.

435
00:28:52,368 --> 00:28:58,207
Pretty soon it'll be nothin' but
featherbeds and silk sheets.

436
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:03,045
A million dollars.

437
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:05,298
Million point two.

438
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:10,303
- 500,000 each.
- 400, Delmar.

439
00:29:10,469 --> 00:29:17,143
Pete, what are you gonna do
with your share of the treasure?

440
00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:19,979
Go out west somewhere.

441
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:23,816
Open a fine restaurant.

442
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:27,403
I'm gonna be the maitre d'.

443
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,323
Greet all the swells.

444
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:33,826
Go to work every day in a bow tie,

445
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:36,162
tuxedo.

446
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:39,915
And all the staff say "yes, sir" and...

447
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:41,417
"no, sir"...

448
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:45,087
and "in a jiffy, Pete".

449
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:49,508
And all my meals for free.

450
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:54,263
What about you, Delmar,

451
00:29:54,513 --> 00:29:57,683
what are you gonna do
with your share of that dough?

452
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:01,687
I'm gonna visit them
foreclosin' son of a guns

453
00:30:01,854 --> 00:30:05,524
down at the Indianola Savings and Loan.

454
00:30:05,775 --> 00:30:11,781
Slap that money on the barrel head
and buy back the family farm.

455
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:16,619
You ain't no kind of man
if you ain't got land.

456
00:30:16,786 --> 00:30:18,704
What about you, Everett?

457
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:22,708
What you have in mind
when you stole it in the first place?

458
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:29,298
Ahem. I... didn't have no plan.

459
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:32,468
Well, that hardly sounds like you.

460
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:35,972
All right, boys!
It's the authorities!

461
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:38,808
Your situation is purty nigh hopeless!

462
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:41,394
Damn, they found our car.

463
00:30:41,644 --> 00:30:44,730
We ain't got the time
and nary the inclination

464
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:47,483
to chat with you boys any further.

465
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,819
Damn, we got to skedaddle.

466
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:53,990
I left my pomade in the car.
Maybe I can creep up.

467
00:30:54,323 --> 00:30:58,577
Don't be a fool, Everett.
We got to R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

468
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:00,830
Where's Tommy?

469
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:06,252
Already lit out, scared out of his wits.

470
00:31:07,336 --> 00:31:10,256
Let's go!

471
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:12,508
Well, hell, it ain't square one.

472
00:31:12,675 --> 00:31:16,762
Ain't no one gonna pick up three
filthy, unshaved hitchhikers.

473
00:31:17,096 --> 00:31:21,017
And one of them a know-it-all
who can't keep his trap shut.

474
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:25,521
The rancour reflected in that remark
I won't dignify with comment.

475
00:31:25,855 --> 00:31:30,026
But I'll address your general
attitude of hopeless negativism.

476
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:33,029
Consider the lilies of the goddam field.

477
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:36,282
Or, hell, look at Delmar
as your paradigm of hope.

478
00:31:36,449 --> 00:31:38,117
Yeah. Look at me.

479
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:42,288
You may call it unreasoning optimism,
you may call it obtuse,

480
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:45,708
but the plain and simple fact
is we got close to...

481
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,544
three days before they...

482
00:31:53,382 --> 00:31:57,637
dam that river.

483
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:23,579
Is this the road to Itta Bena?

484
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:26,499
Uh... Itta Bena?

485
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:31,087
Itta Bena?
Stay on this here road.

486
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:34,674
That ain't right, I was thinking of...

487
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:37,259
- Take this road.
- Nah, that ain't right.

488
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:39,679
Seems to me there's a road...

489
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:42,598
Cow road that used to lead all the way...

490
00:32:42,848 --> 00:32:46,102
Well, most of the way...
Er, that ain't right, either.

491
00:32:46,435 --> 00:32:53,275
- Hop in while you give it a think.
- Right. Delmar.

492
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,452
Any of you boys know your way around
a Walther PPK?

493
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:09,125
Well, we can't help.
I don't believe it's in Mississippi.

494
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:13,045
Friend, some of your folding
money has come unstowed.

495
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:16,048
Just stuff it down that sack, will you?

496
00:33:16,382 --> 00:33:18,467
You boys aren't bad men, I take it?

497
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:20,803
Well, it's funny you should ask.

498
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:25,141
I was bad till yesterday,
but me and Pete here been saved.

499
00:33:25,391 --> 00:33:28,227
I'm Delmar, and that there is Everett.

500
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:32,315
George Nelson. It's a pleasure.

501
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:36,652
Grab the tiller, will you, buddy?

502
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,908
Hand me that chopper.

503
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:46,245
Say, what line of work you in, George?

504
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:49,915
Come and get me, coppers!

505
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:54,420
You flatfooted, lame-brained,
soft-ass sons of bitches!

506
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:59,759
Ah ha! No one can catch me!
I'm George Nelson!

507
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:04,180
I'm bigger than any John, live or limp!

508
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:09,352
I'm ten an' a half feet tall!

509
00:34:10,353 --> 00:34:16,442
Cows. I hate cows worse than coppers!

510
00:34:17,276 --> 00:34:19,528
Oh, George... Not the livestock.

511
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:25,034
Come on, you miserable salaried
sons of bitches! Come and get me!

512
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,552
Come on, boys, we're going for the record.

513
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:45,304
Three banks in two hours!

514
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:56,065
OK, folks, hold the applause
and drop your drawers!

515
00:34:56,315 --> 00:35:01,987
I'm George Nelson, and I'm here
to sack the city Itta Bena!

516
00:35:01,988 --> 00:35:04,240
He's a live wire, though, ain't he?

517
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,576
All the money in a bag.
What are you lookin' at, grandpa?

518
00:35:07,827 --> 00:35:10,413
Pardon me, George,
you got a plan for escapin'?

519
00:35:10,746 --> 00:35:12,331
Sure, boys.

520
00:35:12,498 --> 00:35:14,583
Here's my plan. Ha ha!

521
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,503
They ain't never seen ordnance like this!

522
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:19,588
Thank you, folks.

523
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:24,927
And remember, Jesus saves,
but George Nelson withdraws!

524
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:27,096
Go fix the auto voiture, Pete.

525
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:30,349
Is it Babyface Nelson?

526
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:33,602
Who said that?

527
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:37,606
What ignorant, low-down, slanderisin'

528
00:35:37,815 --> 00:35:41,110
son of a bitch said that?!

529
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:45,906
My name is George Nelson, get me?!

530
00:35:46,115 --> 00:35:49,285
She didn't mean nothin' by it, George.

531
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,622
George Nelson! Not Babyface!

532
00:35:52,955 --> 00:35:57,043
You remember!
And you tell your friends!

533
00:35:57,209 --> 00:35:59,629
I'm George Nelson.

534
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:03,215
Born to raise hell.

535
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:23,194
Well, that was some fun,
now, wasn't it, George?

536
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:24,654
Yeah.

537
00:36:24,904 --> 00:36:27,657
Almost makes me wish I hadn'ta been saved.

538
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,241
Jacking up banks.

539
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:32,995
I can see how a fella'd
derive a whole lot of pleasure

540
00:36:33,245 --> 00:36:35,164
and satisfaction out of it.

541
00:36:35,414 --> 00:36:39,669
- It's OK.
- Hoo, dawgies!

542
00:36:42,922 --> 00:36:45,841
Well...

543
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:49,929
I'm takin' off.

544
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:57,186
You boys might as well keep my...
share of the riches.

545
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:03,692
Well, where are you going, George?

546
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:06,779
I don't know. Who cares?

547
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:12,618
Now, what do you suppose is eatin' George?

548
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:17,540
Well, they say that with
the thrill-seeking personality,

549
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:19,500
what goes up must come down.

550
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,962
Top of the world one minute, sad the next.

551
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:27,842
Yes, sir, it's as if
our old friend George is a alley cat

552
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:31,053
and his own damn humours
are swingin' him by the tail.

553
00:37:31,304 --> 00:37:35,057
I wouldn't worry, Delmar.
He'll be back on top again.

554
00:37:35,224 --> 00:37:40,980
I don't think we've seen
the last of George Nelson.

555
00:37:58,914 --> 00:38:01,917
<i>Don't be saps for Pappy.</i>

556
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:04,587
<i>Homer Stokes for governor.</i>

557
00:38:04,754 --> 00:38:09,342
<i>Let's sweep this state clean.
Vote for Stokes, brother.</i>

558
00:38:09,675 --> 00:38:13,179
<i>...meet with the darkness
and strive</i>

559
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:18,351
<i>The sunny side you also may view</i>

560
00:38:18,517 --> 00:38:20,936
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

561
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,105
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

562
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:26,692
Aw, shh. Hang on!
I'm gonna slap one on here.

563
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:29,195
Folks, here's my cousin Ezra's niece,

564
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:31,364
Eudora from out of Greenwood,

565
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,700
doin' a little number
with her cousin Tom-Tom,

566
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:39,789
which I predict you
gonna enjoy thoroughly.

567
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:46,712
Now, what can I do you for, Mr French?

568
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:50,049
How can I lay a hold
of them Soggy Bottom Boys?

569
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:53,803
Soggy Bottom.
I don't precisely recollect them.

570
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:57,515
They cut a record a few days ago,
an old-timey harmony thing,

571
00:38:57,765 --> 00:38:59,850
with a guitar accomp... accomp...

572
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:03,145
Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember them.

573
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:05,231
Coloured fellas, I believe.

574
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:07,942
Yes, sir, they a fine bunch of boys.

575
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:11,570
They sang into yonder can,
then skedaddled.

576
00:39:11,821 --> 00:39:15,574
Well, that record is just
goin' through the goddam roof.

577
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:18,160
- They playin' it far away as Mobile.
- No.

578
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,329
Whole damn state's goin' apey.

579
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:23,916
Well, it was a powerful air.

580
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:27,670
Hot damn, we gotta find them boys
and sign 'em to a fat contract.

581
00:39:27,837 --> 00:39:31,757
Hell's bells, Mr Lund, if we don't,
the goddam competition will.

582
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:35,303
Oh, mercy, yes, we got
to beat that competition.

583
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:37,013
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

584
00:39:37,263 --> 00:39:39,015
<i>Fly away</i>

585
00:39:39,223 --> 00:39:43,894

Delmar! Over here!

606
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:20,199
Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys
performing "Man of Constant Sorrow"?

607
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:23,119
No, ma'am. We got
a new shipment in yesterday.

608
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:26,622
Sorry, but we just can't
keep 'em on our shelves.

00:42:45,868 --> 00:42:47,036
Shut up, Delmar.

627
00:42:56,295 --> 00:43:00,883
Pull over! Pull over!

628
00:43:06,555 --> 00:43:10,101
Guess old Pete's got the itch.

629
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,564
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

630
00:43:15,898 --> 00:43:19,568
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

631
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:23,072
<i>Your mama's gone away,
and your daddy's gonna stay</i>

632
00:43:23,406 --> 00:43:29,662
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

633
00:43:29,912 --> 00:43:34,250
<i>- Go to sleep, you little baby...
- Howdy do, ladies? Name of Pete.</i>

634
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:38,004
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

635
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:41,841
<i>Everybody's gone
in the cotton and the corn</i>

636
00:43:42,091 --> 00:43:47,263
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby...</i>

637
00:43:47,638 --> 00:43:48,931
You gonna introduce us?

638
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:52,935
I don't know their names.
I seen 'em first!

639
00:43:53,102 --> 00:43:56,605
<i>You're sweet, little baby</i>

640
00:43:56,856 --> 00:44:01,360
<i>Honey in the rock,
and the sugar don't stop</i>

641
00:44:01,694 --> 00:44:06,616
<i>Gonna bring a bottle to the baby</i>

642
00:44:06,782 --> 00:44:11,787
<i>Don't you weep, pretty baby</i>

643
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:15,541
<i>Don't you weep, pretty baby</i>

644
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:19,712
<i>She's long gone with her red shoes on</i>

645
00:44:19,962 --> 00:44:25,051
<i>Gonna need another lovin' baby...</i>

646
00:44:25,384 --> 00:44:29,597
Ladies, my name is Ulysses Everett McGill,

647
00:44:29,805 --> 00:44:35,478
and, well, you three ladies
are about the... the prettiest...

648
00:44:35,645 --> 00:44:38,814
<i>You and me and the devil makes three</i>

649
00:44:38,981 --> 00:44:44,320
<i>Don't need no other lovin' baby...</i>

650
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,655
Water lilies, uh...

651
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:50,451
<i>- Go to sleep, you little baby...
- Corn liquor.</i>

652
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:53,996
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

653
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:57,917
<i>You and me and the devil makes three</i>

654
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:04,340
<i>Don't need no other lovin' baby</i>

655
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:09,011
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

656
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,682
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

657
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:16,519
<i>Your mama's gone away,
and your daddy's gonna stay</i>

658
00:45:16,852 --> 00:45:23,192
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

659
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:27,613
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

660
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,784
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

661
00:45:32,118 --> 00:45:35,621
<i>Come lay your bones
on the alabaster stones</i>

662
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:42,878
<i>And be my everlovin' baby</i>

663
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:26,756
Everett.

664
00:46:27,423 --> 00:46:31,093
- Everett.
- My hair!

665
00:46:31,344 --> 00:46:34,430
Look at this.

666
00:46:47,026 --> 00:46:48,861
Pete!

667
00:46:49,028 --> 00:46:51,364
Where the heck are you?!

668
00:46:53,616 --> 00:46:58,037
We ain't got time for hide-and-seek!

669
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:00,957
We ain't got time for shenanigans!

670
00:47:01,123 --> 00:47:03,292
Sweet Jesus, Everett.

671
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:07,380
They left his heart!

672
00:47:30,152 --> 00:47:32,822
Delmar, what the heck's got into you?

673
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:34,490
Can't you see it, Everett?

674
00:47:34,824 --> 00:47:38,160
Them sirens did this to Pete.

675
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:44,166
They loved him up
and turned him into a... horny toad.

676
00:47:48,504 --> 00:47:49,839
Pete!

677
00:48:07,356 --> 00:48:11,694
Pete, it's me... Delmar.

678
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:15,364
It's me... Delmar.

679
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,951
- Everett.
- Delmar, what the...?!

680
00:48:19,118 --> 00:48:22,538
What are we gonna do?!

681
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:33,215
I'm not sure that's Pete.

682
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:36,719
Of course it's Pete. Look at him.

683
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:43,142
We got to find some kind of...
wizard can change him back.

684
00:48:45,227 --> 00:48:49,065
I'm just not sure that's Pete.

685
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:54,070
You can't display a toad
in a fine restaurant.

686
00:48:54,236 --> 00:48:55,821
Folks'd go off their feed.

687
00:48:56,155 --> 00:48:59,825
Hey. I just don't think it's right
keeping him under wraps

688
00:48:59,992 --> 00:49:01,661
like we was ashamed of him.

689
00:49:01,911 --> 00:49:03,996
If it is Pete, I am ashamed of him.

690
00:49:04,163 --> 00:49:08,250
He got what he deserved, fornicatin'
with some whore of Babylon.

691
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:10,836
These things don't happen for no reason.

692
00:49:11,087 --> 00:49:13,005
It's a judgment on Pete's character.

693
00:49:13,255 --> 00:49:17,843
Well, the two of us was
fixin' to fornicate.

694
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,763
You'll have to excuse
my rusticated friend,

695
00:49:21,097 --> 00:49:24,183
unaccustomed as he is to city manners.

696
00:49:25,685 --> 00:49:28,771
I guess we'll have a couple of steaks

697
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:30,940
and some, uh, gratiné potatoes,

698
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,776
and wash it down with
your finest bubbly wine.

699
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,362
Oh, I don't suppose you have any...

700
00:49:38,614 --> 00:49:41,117
Maybe the chef could prepare...

701
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:44,870
Just bring us a couple
of leaves of raw cabbage.

702
00:49:45,121 --> 00:49:46,956
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

703
00:49:47,123 --> 00:49:51,294
I don't believe I've seen you boys.
Allow me to introduce myself.

704
00:49:51,544 --> 00:49:55,464
Name of Daniel Teague,
known around here as Big Dan Teague,

705
00:49:55,798 --> 00:49:58,467
Or, pressed for time, Big Dan!
Tout court!

706
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:03,222
Name's Ulysses Everett McGill.
My associate, Delmar O'Donnel.

707
00:50:03,389 --> 00:50:07,059
I detect, like me,
you're endowed with the gift of gab.

708
00:50:07,393 --> 00:50:11,230
I flatter myself such is the case.
In my line, it's plum necessary.

709
00:50:11,564 --> 00:50:14,900
The one thing you don't want...

710
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:17,486
is air in the conversation.

711
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,906
Again we agree.
What kind of work you do, Big Dan?

712
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,659
Sales, Mr McGill, sales!
What do I sell?

713
00:50:23,826 --> 00:50:25,828
The truth, every blessed word of it.

714
00:50:25,995 --> 00:50:28,080
From Genesis down to Revelations.

715
00:50:28,414 --> 00:50:31,000
Yes, the word of God, which, let me say,

716
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:35,087
there's damn good money in
during these times of woe and want.

717
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:39,508
People want answers, and Big Dan
sells the only book that's got 'em.

718
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:44,347
And what do you do,
you and your, uh, tongue-tied friend?

719
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,766
We...

720
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:48,684
We're adventurers, sir,

721
00:50:48,851 --> 00:50:50,519
pursuing an opportunity,

722
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,688
but we're open to others as well.

723
00:50:52,938 --> 00:50:55,941
I like you.
I'm gonna propose you a proposition.

724
00:50:56,275 --> 00:51:00,780
You cover my bill for now,
get your dinner wrapped picnic-style

725
00:51:00,947 --> 00:51:03,449
and we'll retire to more private environs,

726
00:51:03,783 --> 00:51:06,369
where I'll reveal how to make
vast amounts of money

727
00:51:06,702 --> 00:51:08,537
in the service of God Almighty.

728
00:51:08,788 --> 00:51:12,541
Well, why not? I can use
some civilised conversation.

729
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:15,044
Don't forget your shoe box, friend.

730
00:51:15,378 --> 00:51:18,547
Damn shame!
Goddam campaign is lagging!

731
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:23,302
We need a shot in the arm.
Hear me, boys? In the goddam arm!

732
00:51:23,552 --> 00:51:27,890
Election held tomorrow, that
sumbitch Stokes would win in a walk!

733
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,977
He's the reform candidate, Daddy.

734
00:51:31,227 --> 00:51:33,980
- Yeah?
- A lot of people like that reform.

735
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,399
Maybe we should get us some.

736
00:51:36,649 --> 00:51:39,819
I'll reform you,
you soft-headed son of a bitch.

737
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:42,738
How we gonna run reform?
We're the incumbent!

738
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:46,075
Is that the best you can
come up with? Reform?!

739
00:51:46,325 --> 00:51:48,828
Weepin' Jesus on the cross.

740
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:50,579
That's it!

741
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,499
Start drafting my concession speech
right now.

742
00:51:53,749 --> 00:51:55,251
OK, Pappy.

743
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:58,004
I'm just making a point,
you stupid son'bitch.

744
00:51:58,337 --> 00:52:01,674
- Give me back that hat!
- Pappy's just makin' a point.

745
00:52:01,841 --> 00:52:04,427
Shut up!

746
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:23,362
Thank you for that fricassee.
I'm a man of large appetites.

747
00:52:23,529 --> 00:52:26,449
Even with lunch under my belt,
I was a mite peckish.

748
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:27,700
Our pleasure.

749
00:52:28,034 --> 00:52:31,287
Thank you as well for
the conversational hiatus.

750
00:52:31,537 --> 00:52:34,624
I generally refrain
from speech during gustation.

751
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:37,793
There are those who attempt
both at the same time.

752
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:40,046
I find it coarse and vulgar.

753
00:52:40,212 --> 00:52:43,382
- Where were we?
- Making money in the Lord's service.

754
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:46,969
Friend, when you do speak,
it's to the point and I salute you.

755
00:52:47,303 --> 00:52:49,055
Yes, Bible sales.

756
00:52:49,305 --> 00:52:53,559
The trade is not complicated.
There are two things to learn...

757
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:55,478
One, find a wholesaler,

758
00:52:55,645 --> 00:52:57,445
the word of God in bulk, as it were.

759
00:52:57,563 --> 00:53:01,484
Two, recognise your customer.
Who are you dealing with?

760
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:04,654
It's an exercise in psychology,
so to speak.

761
00:53:04,904 --> 00:53:11,911
And it is that which I propose
to give you a lesson in right now.

762
00:53:12,745 --> 00:53:16,415
I like to think I'm an astute
observer of the human scene, too.

763
00:53:16,582 --> 00:53:19,835
No doubt, brother.
I figured as much at the restaurant.

764
00:53:20,169 --> 00:53:25,257
That's why I invited you all out here
for this advanced tutorial.

765
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:28,094
What's going on, Big Dan?

766
00:53:28,427 --> 00:53:31,347
It's all about the money, boys!
That's it!

767
00:53:31,597 --> 00:53:36,352
Gol... durned... money!

768
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:37,436
I don't get it.

769
00:53:40,773 --> 00:53:44,443
I'll just take your show cards.

770
00:53:53,035 --> 00:53:56,539
And whatever you got in the hole.

771
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:04,297
What the...
there ain't nothin' but a damn toad.

772
00:54:04,463 --> 00:54:10,386
No, you don't understand.
That's Pete.

773
00:54:12,805 --> 00:54:14,390
Pete.

774
00:54:14,557 --> 00:54:18,561
You know these give you warts?

775
00:54:25,985 --> 00:54:27,320
End of lesson.

776
00:54:29,989 --> 00:54:32,408
So long, boys. Hee hee!

777
00:54:32,658 --> 00:54:34,827
See you in the funny papers.

778
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:39,332
Y'all seen the end of Big Dan Teague.

779
00:55:01,103 --> 00:55:06,442
Where are they? Talk,
you unreconstructed whelp of a whore!

780
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:08,527
Where they headed?

781
00:55:08,694 --> 00:55:12,031
- Aah!
- Your screams won't save your flesh.

782
00:55:12,281 --> 00:55:14,784
- Aah!
- Only your tongue is, boy.

783
00:55:14,951 --> 00:55:17,536
- Where they headed?
- Aah!

784
00:55:29,548 --> 00:55:32,969
Whoa, hound.

785
00:55:39,225 --> 00:55:42,895
Sweet summer rain.

786
00:55:44,814 --> 00:55:48,150
Like God's own mercy.

787
00:55:48,317 --> 00:55:51,237
Your two friends have abandoned you, Pete.

788
00:55:51,487 --> 00:55:54,657
They don't seem to care about your hide.

789
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:02,999
OK.

790
00:56:06,919 --> 00:56:10,423
Stairway to heaven, Pete.

791
00:56:12,508 --> 00:56:14,093
We shall all meet by and by.

792
00:56:14,427 --> 00:56:17,013
God damn it!

793
00:56:19,098 --> 00:56:20,683
God forgive me!

794
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:24,020
Hold.

795
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,950
Believe me, Delmar, he would
have wanted us to press on.

796
00:56:38,284 --> 00:56:42,371
Pete, rest his soul,
was one sourass son of a bitch

797
00:56:42,538 --> 00:56:45,708
and not given to pointless sentimentality.

798
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:48,878
It don't seem right getting
the treasure without him.

799
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:52,214
Maybe it's for the best he was squished.

800
00:56:52,548 --> 00:56:55,885
Why, he... was barely
a sentient being and...

801
00:56:56,135 --> 00:56:59,472
when we clean up and
get a little smellum in our hair,

802
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:02,475
we're gonna feel
100% better about ourselves

803
00:57:02,808 --> 00:57:05,728
and about... life in general.

804
00:57:07,396 --> 00:57:10,983
Must be near Parchment Farm.

805
00:57:11,233 --> 00:57:12,902
Sorry sons of bitches.

806
00:57:13,235 --> 00:57:16,739
Seems like a year ago
we busted off the farm.

807
00:57:25,998 --> 00:57:27,667
Pete got a brother?

808
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,004
Not that I'm aware.

809
00:57:33,422 --> 00:57:35,591
Heat must be getting to me.

810
00:57:44,266 --> 00:57:48,437
<i>Oh, the storm and its fury raged today</i>

811
00:57:48,688 --> 00:57:53,275
<i>Crushing hope that we cherished so dear</i>

812
00:57:53,526 --> 00:57:58,698
<i>The cloud and storm will in time pass away</i>

813
00:57:58,864 --> 00:58:04,120
<i>And the sun again
will shine bright and clear</i>

814
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:06,872
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

815
00:58:07,123 --> 00:58:09,375
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

816
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:13,879
<i>Keep on the sunny side of life</i>

817
00:58:14,213 --> 00:58:16,299
<i>It will help us every day</i>

818
00:58:16,465 --> 00:58:18,718
<i>It will brighten all the way</i>

819
00:58:18,884 --> 00:58:23,472
<i>If we'll keep on the sunny side of life</i>

820
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:28,561
<i>If we'll keep on the sunny side of life</i>

821
00:58:30,563 --> 00:58:34,317
That was wonderful.
That sure was. Yes.

822
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:37,653
Now, I know The Sunnysiders
would agree with me

823
00:58:37,903 --> 00:58:40,406
when I say that the great state
of Mississippi

824
00:58:40,656 --> 00:58:44,577
cannot afford four more years
of Pappy O'Daniel!

825
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:47,580
Four more years of cronyism!

826
00:58:47,747 --> 00:58:50,666
Nepotism! Rascalism!

827
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:54,754
Of service to the interests!

828
00:58:55,004 --> 00:58:58,090
Now, the choice, she's a clear 'un.

829
00:58:58,424 --> 00:59:01,927
Pappy O'Daniel, slave of the interests...

830
00:59:02,178 --> 00:59:06,432
Homer Stokes, servant of
the little man. Right, little fella?

831
00:59:06,682 --> 00:59:07,933
He ain't lyin'!

832
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:12,104
Ladies and gentlemen,
the little man has admonished me

833
00:59:12,271 --> 00:59:14,774
to grasp the broom of reform

834
00:59:15,024 --> 00:59:17,526
and sweep this state clean!

835
00:59:17,777 --> 00:59:20,863
It's gonna be,
"Back to the flour mill, Pappy"!

836
00:59:21,113 --> 00:59:23,449
The interests can handle themselves!

837
00:59:23,783 --> 00:59:27,620
Come Tuesday,
we're gonna sweep the rascals out!

838
00:59:29,705 --> 00:59:33,626
Clean government is yours for the asking!

839
00:59:35,878 --> 00:59:38,547
Folks, now the little Wharvey gals!

840
00:59:40,216 --> 00:59:44,387
Wharvey gals? Did he just say
"little Wharvey gals"?

841
00:59:44,637 --> 00:59:46,806
Come here, girls.

842
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:48,891
What y'all gonna sing for us?

843
00:59:49,058 --> 00:59:51,060
"In the Highways".

844
00:59:51,394 --> 00:59:54,480
- God damn it all!
- You know them gals, Everett?

845
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:55,982
<i>In the highways</i>

846
00:59:56,315 --> 00:59:57,817
<i>In the hedges</i>

847
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:00,486
<i>In the highways</i>

848
01:00:00,653 --> 01:00:02,238
<i>In the hedges</i>

849
01:00:02,571 --> 01:00:04,824
<i>In the highways</i>

850
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:06,909
<i>In the hedges</i>

851
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:11,080
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working for my Lord</i>

852
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,249
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

853
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:15,334
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

854
01:00:15,668 --> 01:00:19,505
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working for my Lord</i>

855
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,757
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

856
01:00:21,924 --> 01:00:23,926
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

857
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:29,432
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working for my Lord</i>

858
01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:31,517
Hey, girls!

859
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:34,020
Daddy! Daddy!

860
01:00:36,439 --> 01:00:38,441
Daddy? He ain't our daddy.

861
01:00:38,607 --> 01:00:41,777
Hell I ain't.
What's this Wharvey? You're McGills.

862
01:00:42,028 --> 01:00:44,363
Not since you got hit by that train.

863
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,115
What? I wasn't hit by a train.

864
01:00:46,365 --> 01:00:50,286
- Mama says you was hit by a train.
- Blooey! Nothin' left.

865
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,288
Just a grease spot on the L & N.

866
01:00:52,622 --> 01:00:55,207
Damn it, I wasn't hit by any train!

867
01:00:55,374 --> 01:00:56,959
Mama's got us back to Wharvey.

868
01:00:57,209 --> 01:01:00,296
- That's her maiden name.
- You got a maiden name, Daddy?

869
01:01:00,546 --> 01:01:02,632
Daddy don't have a maiden name...

870
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:04,050
That's your misfortune.

871
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,887
- And now mama's got a new beau.
- He's a suitor.

872
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,889
Yeah, I heard about that.

873
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:13,225
Mama says he's bona fide.

874
01:01:13,476 --> 01:01:15,978
Mmm. He give her a ring?

875
01:01:16,228 --> 01:01:17,480
Yes, sir. A big 'un.

876
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:20,232
- Gold and gems.
- Mama checked it.

877
01:01:20,566 --> 01:01:22,401
- It's bona fide.
- He's a suitor.

878
01:01:22,652 --> 01:01:25,154
- What's his name?
- Vernon T Waldrip.

879
01:01:25,321 --> 01:01:27,073
- Uncle Vernon.
- Till tomorrow.

880
01:01:27,323 --> 01:01:28,658
Then he's Daddy.

881
01:01:28,908 --> 01:01:32,662
I am the only daddy you got.
I am the damn pater familias.

882
01:01:32,912 --> 01:01:36,415
But you ain't bona fide.

883
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,752
Where's your mama?

884
01:01:40,002 --> 01:01:44,423
- At the five-and-dime.
- Buying nipples.

885
01:01:45,174 --> 01:01:47,510
<i>This way</i>

886
01:01:47,843 --> 01:01:51,931
<i>To take me home</i>

887
01:01:52,264 --> 01:01:56,852
<i>Kiss me more...</i>

888
01:01:59,939 --> 01:02:03,693
- Daddy!
- Hello, sugar! Ha ha!

889
01:02:03,943 --> 01:02:05,695
How's my little girl?

890
01:02:06,028 --> 01:02:07,530
Hi.

891
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,283
- Who the hell's that?
- Starla Wharvey.

892
01:02:10,449 --> 01:02:12,368
Starla McGill, you mean.

893
01:02:12,702 --> 01:02:15,454
- You never told me.
- Cos you was hit by a train.

894
01:02:15,705 --> 01:02:18,207
Why are you telling our gals
I was hit by a train?

895
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:21,043
Lots of respectable people
been hit by trains.

896
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,129
Judge Hobby was hit by a train.

897
01:02:23,379 --> 01:02:25,047
What was I supposed to say,

898
01:02:25,298 --> 01:02:27,967
that you were jailed
and I divorced you from shame?

899
01:02:28,217 --> 01:02:32,722
I take your point. But it puts me in
an awkward spot vis á vis my progeny.

900
01:02:32,888 --> 01:02:39,478
Hello, Penny.
Is this gentleman bothering you?

901
01:02:40,229 --> 01:02:41,564
You Waldrip?

902
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:44,984
Uh-huh. That's right.

903
01:02:57,496 --> 01:02:59,832
You been using my hair treatment?

904
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:02,084
Your hair treatment?

905
01:03:02,335 --> 01:03:05,671
Excuse me.

906
01:03:07,423 --> 01:03:11,510
I got news. In case you hadn't
noticed, I wasn't hit by a train,

907
01:03:11,677 --> 01:03:14,096
and I have travelled many a weary mile

908
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,768
to be back with my wife
and my six daughters.

909
01:03:19,018 --> 01:03:22,104
- Seven, Daddy!
- That ain't your daddy, Alvanelle.

910
01:03:22,438 --> 01:03:23,938
Your daddy was hit by a train.

911
01:03:24,106 --> 01:03:25,441
Penny, you stop that!

912
01:03:25,775 --> 01:03:27,675
You stop it! Vernon here's got a job.

913
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:31,113
Vernon's got prospects.
He's bona fide. What are you?

914
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,865
I'll tell you what I am...

915
01:03:33,032 --> 01:03:36,285
I'm the pater familias,
and you can't marry him!

916
01:03:36,535 --> 01:03:38,454
I can, I am and I will, tomorrow.

917
01:03:38,788 --> 01:03:41,123
I gotta think about the Wharvey gals.

918
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:43,459
They look to me for answers.

919
01:03:43,709 --> 01:03:45,962
Vernon can buy 'em
lessons on the clarinet.

920
01:03:46,212 --> 01:03:50,049
The only good thing you
ever did was get hit by that train!

921
01:03:50,299 --> 01:03:54,470
Well, you lying, unconstant succubus.

922
01:03:54,637 --> 01:03:58,724
Whoa, whoa!
You can't swear at my fiancée!

923
01:03:58,891 --> 01:04:03,813
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can't marry my wife!

924
01:04:25,418 --> 01:04:28,254
Who is that man?

925
01:04:28,421 --> 01:04:31,173
He's not my husband.

926
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:37,179
Just a drifter, I guess.
Just some no-account drifter.

927
01:04:39,348 --> 01:04:43,352
And stay out of the Woolsworth!

928
01:04:47,857 --> 01:04:50,192
<i>I'll bet she does imitations, too.</i>

929
01:04:50,526 --> 01:04:53,446
Deceitful, two-faced she-wolf.

930
01:04:53,696 --> 01:04:55,948
Never trust a female, Delmar.

931
01:04:56,198 --> 01:05:00,786
Remember that precept and your time
with me won't have been ill-spent.

932
01:05:01,037 --> 01:05:04,123
- OK, Everett.
- "Hit by a train".

933
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:06,876
Truth means nothing to a woman, Delmar.

934
01:05:07,126 --> 01:05:10,630
Triumph of the subjective.
You ever been with a woman?

935
01:05:10,963 --> 01:05:14,634
Well, I've...
I got to get the family farm back

936
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:17,470
before I can start thinking about that.

937
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,639
That's right. If then.

938
01:05:19,805 --> 01:05:23,893
Believe me, a woman's the
most fiendish instrument of torture

939
01:05:24,143 --> 01:05:26,812
ever devised to bedevil the days of man.

940
01:05:27,063 --> 01:05:29,815
Everett, I never figured you
for a pater familias.

941
01:05:30,149 --> 01:05:34,570
Ohh, yes. I have spread my seed.

942
01:05:34,737 --> 01:05:36,238
And look what it's...

943
01:05:38,157 --> 01:05:43,329
God damn it.
What the hell...?

944
01:06:41,304 --> 01:06:46,142
OK, boys.
Enjoy your picture show.

945
01:06:50,646 --> 01:06:54,233
<i>I have no money, honey</i>

946
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,569
<i>How can I change?</i>

947
01:06:56,819 --> 01:07:02,325
Do... not... seek the treasure.

948
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:10,583
Do not... seek the treasure.

949
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:12,835
It's a bushwhack.

950
01:07:13,085 --> 01:07:16,005
They're fixin' an ambush.

951
01:07:16,172 --> 01:07:20,509
Do not seek the treasure.

952
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:29,268
We... we thought you was...

953
01:07:29,518 --> 01:07:32,688
a toad.

954
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:42,365
We... thought...
you... was... a... toad.

955
01:07:44,784 --> 01:07:48,955
Do not seek the treasure.

956
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:53,542
Quiet there!
Watch the picture!

957
01:07:58,047 --> 01:07:59,465
I signed that bill.

958
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:02,385
I signed a dozen agriculture bills.

959
01:08:02,635 --> 01:08:05,388
Everyone knows I'm a friend of the farmer.

960
01:08:05,721 --> 01:08:08,557
What I gotta do, start diddling livestock?

961
01:08:08,724 --> 01:08:11,978
We can't do that, Daddy.
We might offend our constituency.

962
01:08:12,228 --> 01:08:17,650
We ain't got a constituency!
Stokes got a constituency!

963
01:08:17,733 --> 01:08:19,902
Well, it's a well-run campaign.

964
01:08:20,152 --> 01:08:21,988
Midget and broom and whatnot.

965
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:25,157
- Devil his due.
- Hell of an organisation.

966
01:08:25,324 --> 01:08:28,577
- Say, I got an idea.
- What's that, Junior?

967
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:32,415
We can hire us a little fella
even smaller than Stokes's.

968
01:08:32,748 --> 01:08:34,917
You slump-shouldered sack of nuts!

969
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:38,087
We'd look like a bunch
of johnny-come-latelys

970
01:08:38,254 --> 01:08:40,256
bringin' out our own midget.

971
01:08:40,589 --> 01:08:42,008
Don't matter how stumpy!

972
01:08:42,341 --> 01:08:47,013
That's the goddam problem, people
think Stokes has got fresh ideas.

973
01:08:47,346 --> 01:08:49,432
He's au courant and we're the past!

974
01:08:49,598 --> 01:08:51,017
It's a problem of...

975
01:08:51,267 --> 01:08:52,852
- Perception.
- Right.

976
01:08:53,102 --> 01:08:56,022
- He's pulling our pants down.
- Gonna paddle some behind.

977
01:08:56,188 --> 01:08:58,357
Ain't gonna paddle it. Gonna kick it.

978
01:08:58,691 --> 01:09:02,278
- No, he's gonna paddle it.
- That's not a proper description.

979
01:09:02,528 --> 01:09:09,452
- That's how I'd characterise it.
- It's more of a kickin' situation.

980
01:09:23,215 --> 01:09:28,638
God... God forgive me.

981
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:33,142
I could not gaze upon that fireshow.

982
01:09:33,392 --> 01:09:36,479
Pete.

983
01:09:36,646 --> 01:09:41,233
- Hold still!
- Can't... stand much longer.

984
01:09:41,484 --> 01:09:44,403
It was... it was
a mo-moment of weakness.

985
01:09:44,654 --> 01:09:46,656
Quit babblin', we gotta skedaddle.

986
01:09:46,906 --> 01:09:48,991
That's all I got.

987
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:50,826
They lured me out for a bathe

988
01:09:51,077 --> 01:09:54,497
and then they dunked me,
trussed me up like a hog,

989
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,499
and turned me in for the bounty.

990
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:59,418
Shoulda guessed it.
Typical womanly behaviour.

991
01:09:59,585 --> 01:10:02,088
We're lucky we left before they came back.

992
01:10:02,338 --> 01:10:04,090
We didn't abandon you, Pete.

993
01:10:04,256 --> 01:10:06,509
We just thought you was a toad.

994
01:10:06,676 --> 01:10:09,095
No, they never did turn me into a toad.

995
01:10:09,261 --> 01:10:12,098
Well, that was our mistake, then.

996
01:10:12,348 --> 01:10:17,353
We was beat up by a Bible salesman
and banished from Woolworths.

997
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,523
Everett, was it the one branch
or all of them?

998
01:10:20,773 --> 01:10:23,609
Well, I ain't had it easy, either, boys.

999
01:10:23,776 --> 01:10:28,447
Frankly, uh, well, I...

1000
01:10:29,448 --> 01:10:31,951
I spilt my guts about the treasure.

1001
01:10:35,037 --> 01:10:39,208
I'm awful sorry I betrayed you, fellas.

1002
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:43,212
Must be my Hogwallop blood.

1003
01:10:44,046 --> 01:10:45,881
That's all right, Pete.

1004
01:10:46,132 --> 01:10:49,135
Awful white of you to take it
like that, Everett.

1005
01:10:49,468 --> 01:10:51,971
I feel wretched.

1006
01:10:52,138 --> 01:10:55,725
Spoiling your play for
a million dollar point two.

1007
01:10:55,975 --> 01:10:58,894
You should rip out my guts.

1008
01:10:59,228 --> 01:11:01,397
No, that's all right.

1009
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:08,236
You boys are true friends! Ohh!

1010
01:11:08,237 --> 01:11:10,906
You're my beaucoup friends.

1011
01:11:11,115 --> 01:11:15,077
Pete, I don't want you to
beat yourself up about this, eh?

1012
01:11:15,286 --> 01:11:22,293
I can't help it, but
that's a... a wonderful thing to say.

1013
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:29,300
Yeah. Pete, uh...

1014
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:34,180
Well, fact of the matter is...

1015
01:11:36,349 --> 01:11:38,017
Damn it...

1016
01:11:38,225 --> 01:11:41,604
There ain't no treasure.

1017
01:11:43,356 --> 01:11:45,608
Fact of the matter is there never was.

1018
01:11:45,983 --> 01:11:47,610
But...

1019
01:11:47,944 --> 01:11:53,783
So where's all the money
from the armoured car job?

1020
01:11:53,866 --> 01:11:56,619
I never knocked over no armoured car.

1021
01:11:56,786 --> 01:12:00,206
I was sent up for
practising law without a license.

1022
01:12:00,456 --> 01:12:02,208
- But...
- I had to bust out.

1023
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:07,879
My wife wrote me she was
getting married, I gotta stop it.

1024
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,008
I had two weeks left on my sentence.

1025
01:12:11,217 --> 01:12:13,302
I couldn't wait, wedding's tomorrow.

1026
01:12:13,469 --> 01:12:20,476
My added time for the escape,
I don't get out now till 19... 87.

1027
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:23,562
I am sorry about that.

1028
01:12:23,896 --> 01:12:29,151
I'll be... 84 years old.

1029
01:12:29,402 --> 01:12:33,322
I guess they'll tack on
50 years for me, too.

1030
01:12:33,489 --> 01:12:37,910
Boys, we was chained together.
I had to tell you something.

1031
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:43,332
Busting out alone
was not an option. I'm sorry.

1032
01:12:43,582 --> 01:12:47,169
84 years old.

1033
01:12:47,253 --> 01:12:50,631
Well, I'll only be 82.

1034
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,592
You! You ruined my life!

1035
01:12:53,926 --> 01:12:56,512
You ruined my life!

1036
01:12:56,887 --> 01:12:58,848
I do apologise, Pete.

1037
01:12:59,181 --> 01:13:03,436
84 years old!
I'm becoming Papillon!

1038
01:13:03,728 --> 01:13:05,229
Delmar!

1039
01:13:09,442 --> 01:13:13,195
Now, boys. Boys.

1040
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:33,466
<i>Eeny meeny meiny mo</i>

1041
01:14:11,337 --> 01:14:16,717
<i>Oh death</i>

1042
01:14:16,926 --> 01:14:22,014
<i>Whoa death</i>

1043
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:27,270
<i>Won't you spare me over till another year?</i>

1044
01:14:32,608 --> 01:14:35,486
<i>Well, I am death, none can excel</i>

1045
01:14:35,695 --> 01:14:40,116
<i>I'll open the door to heaven or hell</i>

1046
01:14:40,283 --> 01:14:43,035
<i>Whoa, death, someone would pray</i>

1047
01:14:43,244 --> 01:14:47,999
<i>Could you wait to call me another day?</i>

1048
01:14:48,207 --> 01:14:49,292
<i>Children pray...</i>

1049
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:54,046
That's Tommy.
They got Tommy!

1050
01:14:55,131 --> 01:14:56,340
Noose.

1051
01:14:56,632 --> 01:14:59,552
<i>No longer prayin'...</i>

1052
01:14:59,927 --> 01:15:04,307
Sweet Jesus, we got to save him.

1053
01:15:04,473 --> 01:15:07,226
<i>I'll fix your feet till you can't walk</i>

1054
01:15:07,393 --> 01:15:12,481
<i>I'll lock your jaw till you can't talk</i>

1055
01:15:12,815 --> 01:15:16,068
<i>I'll close your eyes so you can't see</i>

1056
01:15:16,235 --> 01:15:20,781
<i>- It's very dark...
- The colour guard.</i>

1057
01:15:21,157 --> 01:15:24,744
<i>Death, I come to take the soul</i>

1058
01:15:24,952 --> 01:15:29,498
<i>Leave the body and leave it cold</i>

1059
01:15:29,832 --> 01:15:33,294
<i>Oh death</i>

1060
01:15:33,586 --> 01:15:37,840
<i>Whoa death</i>

1061
01:15:38,049 --> 01:15:43,763
<i>Won't you spare me over till another year?</i>

1062
01:15:45,598 --> 01:15:48,267
Brothers!

1063
01:15:48,601 --> 01:15:51,187
Oh, brothers!

1064
01:15:51,437 --> 01:15:58,444
We have all gathered here to preserve
our hallowed culture and heritage

1065
01:15:59,528 --> 01:16:05,618
from intrusion, inclusion and dilution

1066
01:16:05,785 --> 01:16:08,621
of colour, of creed,

1067
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:10,873
and of our old-time religion.

1068
01:16:11,123 --> 01:16:15,586
We aim to pull evil up by the root

1069
01:16:15,878 --> 01:16:21,842
before it chokes out the flower
of our culture and heritage.

1070
01:16:22,134 --> 01:16:25,930
And our women,
let's not forget those ladies, y'all,

1071
01:16:26,222 --> 01:16:29,058
looking to us for protection

1072
01:16:29,225 --> 01:16:34,063
from darkies, from Jews, from papists,

1073
01:16:34,355 --> 01:16:37,066
and from all those smart-ass folks

1074
01:16:37,316 --> 01:16:40,069
say we come descended from monkeys.

1075
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,406
- That's not my culture and heritage.
- Yes!

1076
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:45,074
Is it yours?

1077
01:16:45,408 --> 01:16:47,493
No!

1078
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,329
And so...

1079
01:16:50,496 --> 01:16:52,540
we gonna hang us a Negro.

1080
01:17:06,512 --> 01:17:11,517
I ain't never harmed you,
neither of you gentlemen.

1081
01:17:33,456 --> 01:17:37,376
I ain't never harmed nobody.

1082
01:17:39,128 --> 01:17:41,297
- Hey, Tommy.
- Huh?

1083
01:17:41,589 --> 01:17:43,382
Tommy, we come to rescue you.

1084
01:17:43,633 --> 01:17:45,718
That's mighty kind of you boys,

1085
01:17:45,968 --> 01:17:49,138
but I don't think nothing's
going to save me now.

1086
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:53,309
The devil's come to collect his due.

1087
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:55,478
Don't be crazy, Tommy.

1088
01:17:55,686 --> 01:17:57,480
You don't wanna get hanged.

1089
01:17:57,772 --> 01:17:59,857
Well, naw, I don't reckon I do,

1090
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:04,153
but that's the way it's working out.

1091
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:07,239
Tommy, I got a plan.

1092
01:18:10,284 --> 01:18:12,828
No!

1093
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:18,918
The colour guard is coloured.

1094
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:24,590
Who made them the colour guard?

1095
01:18:26,175 --> 01:18:28,469
Run, boys!

1096
01:18:35,101 --> 01:18:36,185
No, no, son!

1097
01:18:39,188 --> 01:18:43,859
Can't let that flag touch the ground!

1098
01:19:07,633 --> 01:19:09,552
Get your hands off me.

1099
01:19:09,802 --> 01:19:12,263
I can do this myself, get away from me.

1100
01:19:12,555 --> 01:19:14,390
We should hire this man away.

1101
01:19:14,724 --> 01:19:17,018
- Good idea, Pappy.
- Hell of an idea.

1102
01:19:17,226 --> 01:19:20,980
- Can't beat 'em, join 'em.
- He'll join us, run our campaign.

1103
01:19:21,188 --> 01:19:25,276
- Power, wealth...
- No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

1104
01:19:25,568 --> 01:19:29,238
- Not with his blandishments.
- And powers of persuasion.

1105
01:19:29,447 --> 01:19:32,575
- What's his name again?
- The campaign manager?

1106
01:19:32,742 --> 01:19:34,577
- Waldrip.
- Vernon Waldrip.

1107
01:19:34,744 --> 01:19:38,331
- Vernon T Waldrip.
- Hmm.

1108
01:19:43,419 --> 01:19:45,630
It's invitation only.

1109
01:19:45,838 --> 01:19:48,758
- We'll have to sneak in.
- Hold on.

1110
01:19:48,924 --> 01:19:50,384
Wait a minute.

1111
01:19:50,593 --> 01:19:52,928
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

1112
01:19:53,095 --> 01:19:57,266
Since we've been following your lead,
we got nothing but trouble.

1113
01:19:57,516 --> 01:20:00,269
I've gotten this close to being strung up

1114
01:20:00,519 --> 01:20:03,522
and consumed in a fire and whipped no end

1115
01:20:03,856 --> 01:20:05,608
and sunstroked and soggied.

1116
01:20:05,858 --> 01:20:07,276
And turned into a frog.

1117
01:20:07,526 --> 01:20:08,976
He wasn't turned into a frog.

1118
01:20:09,153 --> 01:20:13,449
Almost loved up, though.

1119
01:20:13,783 --> 01:20:16,702
So, you're against me now, too?

1120
01:20:16,953 --> 01:20:20,539
Is that how it is, boys?

1121
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:27,838
The whole world and God Almighty...
now you?

1122
01:20:30,967 --> 01:20:32,718
I guess I deserve it.

1123
01:20:33,052 --> 01:20:36,555
Boys...

1124
01:20:36,889 --> 01:20:39,850
I know that I made some tactical mistakes,

1125
01:20:40,059 --> 01:20:43,145
but if you just stick with me,
I got a plan.

1126
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:45,731
Believe me, we can fix this thing.

1127
01:20:45,982 --> 01:20:48,484
I'll get my wife back, we'll leave.

1128
01:20:52,571 --> 01:20:55,491
Goddam disgrace!

1129
01:20:55,658 --> 01:20:58,244
Made a travesty of the entire evening.

1130
01:20:58,494 --> 01:21:02,331
Ohh! What I wouldn't give
to get a hold of those agitators.

1131
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:06,335
Whoever heard of such behaviour,
even amongst the coloured?

1132
01:21:06,585 --> 01:21:11,173
Mulattos, maybe. I suspect some
miscegenation in their heritage.

1133
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:14,093
Using a Confederate flag as a missile!

1134
01:21:14,427 --> 01:21:17,680
Crazy! No one's ever gonna believe
we're a real band.

1135
01:21:17,888 --> 01:21:20,766
I just gotta get close enough
to talk to her.

1136
01:21:21,017 --> 01:21:24,437
Comin' with us got more future than
marrying a guy called Waldrip.

1137
01:21:24,687 --> 01:21:27,189
I'm goddam bona fide.
I got the answers.

1138
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,693
Everett, my beard itches.

1139
01:21:41,871 --> 01:21:46,459
"In the Jailhouse Now", fellas.
Neighbourhood of B.

1140
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:58,638
Penny. Ahem.

1141
01:21:59,096 --> 01:22:03,851
- It's me.
- No.

1142
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:05,353
Honey!

1143
01:22:05,645 --> 01:22:09,315
<i>I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob</i>

1144
01:22:09,523 --> 01:22:12,193
<i>He used to steal, gamble and rob</i>

1145
01:22:12,401 --> 01:22:17,657
<i>He thought he was the smartest guy around</i>

1146
01:22:17,865 --> 01:22:19,158
<i>Well, I...</i>

1147
01:22:19,492 --> 01:22:24,163
We're leaving the state, pursuing
opportunities in another venue.

1148
01:22:24,413 --> 01:22:26,499
I got big plans.

1149
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:29,502
Not minstrels, I'm going to be a dentist.

1150
01:22:29,752 --> 01:22:34,340
I know this guy
who'll print me up a license.

1151
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:37,718
<i>He's in the jailhouse now</i>

1152
01:22:37,927 --> 01:22:41,514
<i>Well, I told him once or twice</i>

1153
01:22:41,847 --> 01:22:45,851
<i>To stop playin' cards and a-shootin' dice</i>

1154
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:49,647
<i>He's in the jailhouse now</i>

1155
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:12,128
<i>Bob liked to play his poker...</i>

1156
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:16,549
Why, that is an improper suggestion.

1157
01:23:16,841 --> 01:23:21,887
I can't switch sides
in the middle of a campaign...

1158
01:23:22,054 --> 01:23:25,641
especially to work for a man
who lacks moral fibre.

1159
01:23:25,808 --> 01:23:29,145
Moral fibre?
Why, you pasty-face son'bitch.

1160
01:23:29,353 --> 01:23:30,896
I invented moral fibre.

1161
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:34,483
Pappy was displaying rectitude
when that egghead you work for

1162
01:23:34,817 --> 01:23:37,111
was still messin' his drawers!

1163
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,072
- Psst! Honey.
- Go away.

1164
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:42,742
I want to be what
you want me to be, honey.

1165
01:23:42,992 --> 01:23:45,828
I want you and the gals to come with me.

1166
01:23:46,037 --> 01:23:50,833
<i>To stop playin' cards
and a-shootin' dice...</i>

1167
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:54,503
What are you doing here, Pappy?

1168
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:56,756
Someone let on we were giving out liquor.

1169
01:23:56,964 --> 01:23:59,925
You'll laugh out the other side
of your face November.

1170
01:24:00,259 --> 01:24:01,927
Pappy'll be laughin' then.

1171
01:24:02,136 --> 01:24:05,848
- Not out the other side of his face.
- Just the regular side.

1172
01:24:19,862 --> 01:24:21,948
They're my daughters, too, Penny.

1173
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:23,699
Ain't you ever heard of...?

1174
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:26,285
<i>In constant sorrow</i>

1175
01:24:43,636 --> 01:24:47,473
<i>I am the man</i>

1176
01:24:47,807 --> 01:24:50,393
<i>Of constant sorrow</i>

1177
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:53,062
<i>I've seen trouble...</i>

1178
01:24:53,271 --> 01:24:55,982
Hot damn!
It's the Soggy Bottom Boys!

1179
01:24:56,357 --> 01:25:00,903
<i>I bid farewell</i>

1180
01:25:01,112 --> 01:25:03,114
<i>To old Kentucky</i>

1181
01:25:03,322 --> 01:25:08,911
<i>The place where I was born and raised</i>

1182
01:25:09,161 --> 01:25:11,664
<i>The place where he</i>

1183
01:25:11,998 --> 01:25:16,210
<i>Was born and raised...</i>

1184
01:25:35,605 --> 01:25:38,065
Holy moly! These boys are a hit!

1185
01:25:38,357 --> 01:25:40,735
But, Pappy, they's integrated.

1186
01:25:40,943 --> 01:25:43,279
Wait a minute.

1187
01:25:43,446 --> 01:25:45,948
Folks don't mind they's integrated.

1188
01:25:46,198 --> 01:25:50,202
You's miscegenated.
All you boys is miscegenated!

1189
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:51,662
Gimme a microphone!

1190
01:25:52,038 --> 01:25:55,124
Gimme a microphone!
Gimme a microphone!

1191
01:25:55,333 --> 01:26:00,796
These boys is not white.
Hell, they ain't even old-timey.

1192
01:26:01,005 --> 01:26:03,466
I happen to know, ladies and gentlemen,

1193
01:26:03,674 --> 01:26:06,469
that this band of miscreants,
this very evening,

1194
01:26:06,802 --> 01:26:12,224
interfered with a lynch mob
in the performance of its duties.

1195
01:26:12,475 --> 01:26:13,893
It's true!

1196
01:26:14,101 --> 01:26:16,646
See, I belong to a certain secret society.

1197
01:26:16,812 --> 01:26:19,815
I don't believe I gotta
mention its name, you know?

1198
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:22,568
Let 'em play! Go on!

1199
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:26,322
And these boys here,

1200
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:30,242
they trampled all over our
venerated observances and rituals.

1201
01:26:30,493 --> 01:26:33,371
This here music is over, all right?

1202
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:35,164
And I have... No! Hey!

1203
01:26:35,414 --> 01:26:37,917
Hey, I ain't... listen to me.

1204
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:40,169
Folks, listen to me. I...

1205
01:26:40,419 --> 01:26:43,506
These boys desecrated a fiery cross.

1206
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,093
We's all havin' a good time!

1207
01:26:47,259 --> 01:26:51,347
And they's convicts, folks,
fugitives escaped off the farm.

1208
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:55,434
Now, folks, these boys gotta
be remanded to the authorities.

1209
01:26:55,726 --> 01:26:56,936
Criminals!

1210
01:26:57,186 --> 01:26:59,605
And I have it from the highest authority

1211
01:26:59,772 --> 01:27:02,942
that that Negro
sold his soul to the devil!

1212
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:08,030
Wait a minute, folks.
It's true!

1213
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:09,072
It's true!

1214
01:27:10,408 --> 01:27:11,534
Wait a minute.

1215
01:27:11,784 --> 01:27:14,870
Is you is, or is you ain't
my constituency?

1216
01:27:15,204 --> 01:27:16,122
No!

1217
01:27:16,455 --> 01:27:18,958
<i>Is you is, or is you ain't
my constituency?</i>

1218
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:21,294
No!

1219
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:24,046
Is you is...

1220
01:27:24,422 --> 01:27:28,801
Is you is,
or is you ain't my constituency?

1221
01:27:28,968 --> 01:27:31,470
Oh, come on, folks.

1222
01:27:31,721 --> 01:27:33,139
No. It's Homer now.

1223
01:27:33,472 --> 01:27:35,433
I'm a friend of the little man.

1224
01:27:46,902 --> 01:27:50,156
This is not fair!
Hey! Come on!

1225
01:27:53,409 --> 01:27:58,998
Come on, we got a little
misunderstanding here. God damn!

1226
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:08,090
<i>It's fair to tell</i>

1227
01:28:08,257 --> 01:28:10,885
<i>My only lover</i>

1228
01:28:11,093 --> 01:28:13,471
<i>I never expect</i>

1229
01:28:13,846 --> 01:28:17,350
<i>To see you again</i>

1230
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:22,021
<i>For I'm bound to ride</i>

1231
01:28:22,271 --> 01:28:24,941
<i>That northern railroad</i>

1232
01:28:25,191 --> 01:28:30,112
<i>Perhaps I'll die upon that train</i>

1233
01:28:30,363 --> 01:28:35,910
<i>Perhaps he'll die upon his train...</i>

1234
01:28:36,202 --> 01:28:39,705
God damn!
Opportunity knocks!

1235
01:28:39,872 --> 01:28:42,166
Get out of my way!

1236
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:44,961
<i>I'm just a stranger</i>

1237
01:28:45,211 --> 01:28:47,838
<i>In case you ever</i>

1238
01:28:48,047 --> 01:28:50,299
<i>See your man...</i>

1239
01:28:51,801 --> 01:28:56,472
<i>But there is one promise</i>

1240
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:58,849
<i>That is given</i>

1241
01:28:59,141 --> 01:29:01,560
<i>I'll meet you on</i>

1242
01:29:01,894 --> 01:29:04,522
<i>God's golden shore</i>

1243
01:29:04,814 --> 01:29:07,400
<i>He'll meet you on</i>

1244
01:29:07,692 --> 01:29:10,319
<i>God's golden shore</i>

1245
01:29:10,569 --> 01:29:14,407
That's fine. That's fine!

1246
01:29:17,243 --> 01:29:19,704
Ladies and gentlemans,

1247
01:29:19,912 --> 01:29:22,248
here and listening at home,

1248
01:29:22,498 --> 01:29:25,668
the great state of Mississippi...

1249
01:29:25,876 --> 01:29:27,753
Pappy O'Daniel, Governor...

1250
01:29:28,045 --> 01:29:33,926
wants to thank the Soggy Bottom Boys
for that wonderful performance.

1251
01:29:36,387 --> 01:29:40,182
And it looks like the only man
in this great state

1252
01:29:40,474 --> 01:29:42,351
who ain't a music lover

1253
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,230
is my esteemed opponent
in the upcoming, Homer Stokes.

1254
01:29:46,522 --> 01:29:49,025
There ain't no accounting for taste.

1255
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:53,696
Sounded to me like he was harbouring
a hateful grudge

1256
01:29:53,946 --> 01:29:55,656
against the Soggy Bottom Boys

1257
01:29:55,865 --> 01:29:58,367
on account of their rough and rowdy past.

1258
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:03,497
Looks like Homer Stokes
is the kind of fellow

1259
01:30:03,789 --> 01:30:06,083
who wants to cast the first stone.

1260
01:30:06,292 --> 01:30:09,045
Well, I'm with you, folks.

1261
01:30:09,211 --> 01:30:12,465
I'm a forgive-and-forget
Christian, and I say...

1262
01:30:12,715 --> 01:30:18,304
if their rambunctiousness
and misdemeanoring is behind them...

1263
01:30:18,554 --> 01:30:19,597
It is, ain't it?

1264
01:30:19,805 --> 01:30:21,474
Yes, sir, it is.

1265
01:30:21,724 --> 01:30:23,643
Well, then, I say,

1266
01:30:23,976 --> 01:30:26,228
by the power vested in me,

1267
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:30,900
these boys is hereby pardoned!

1268
01:30:33,653 --> 01:30:36,072
And furthermore...

1269
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,950
in the second
Pappy O'Daniel administration,

1270
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:42,578
these boys is gonna be my brain trust!

1271
01:30:46,999 --> 01:30:48,834
What's that mean, Everett?

1272
01:30:49,085 --> 01:30:53,172
Well, it means you and me
and Pete and Tommy are gonna be

1273
01:30:53,339 --> 01:30:55,633
the power behind the throne, so to speak.

1274
01:30:58,761 --> 01:31:03,391
So, without further ado,
and by way of endorsing my candidacy,

1275
01:31:03,683 --> 01:31:05,268
the Soggy Bottom Boys

1276
01:31:05,434 --> 01:31:09,605
is gonna lead us all
in a chorus of "You Are My Sunshine".

1277
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:13,692
Ain't you, boys?

1278
01:31:13,693 --> 01:31:14,944
One of our favourites.

1279
01:31:15,111 --> 01:31:19,948
Son... you're gonna go far.

1280
01:31:19,949 --> 01:31:22,451
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

1281
01:31:22,785 --> 01:31:25,037
<i>My only sunshine</i>

1282
01:31:25,288 --> 01:31:27,873
<i>You make me happy</i>

1283
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,376
<i>When skies are grey</i>

1284
01:31:30,710 --> 01:31:33,045
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

1285
01:31:33,296 --> 01:31:35,965
<i>How much I love you</i>

1286
01:31:36,299 --> 01:31:37,800
<i>Please don't take</i>

1287
01:31:37,967 --> 01:31:42,555
<i>My sunshine away</i>

1288
01:31:44,974 --> 01:31:48,644
I guess Vernon T Waldrip
is gonna be going on relief.

1289
01:31:48,811 --> 01:31:51,647
Maybe I can throw
a little patronage his way,

1290
01:31:51,981 --> 01:31:54,900
get him a job digging
or rounding up stray dogs.

1291
01:31:55,067 --> 01:31:57,570
So, is the marriage off, Miss Wharvey?

1292
01:31:57,903 --> 01:32:01,407
McGill. No. The marriage
will take place as planned.

1293
01:32:01,741 --> 01:32:02,992
With a change of cast.

1294
01:32:03,242 --> 01:32:05,911
Me and the little lady
are gonna pick up the pieces

1295
01:32:06,162 --> 01:32:09,332
and re-tie the knot,
mixaphorically speaking.

1296
01:32:09,665 --> 01:32:11,751
You boys are invited, of course.

1297
01:32:12,001 --> 01:32:13,753
Hell, you're the best men.

1298
01:32:13,919 --> 01:32:16,255
I already got the rings.

1299
01:32:16,422 --> 01:32:20,092
- Where's your ring?
- I ain't worn it since our divorce.

1300
01:32:20,343 --> 01:32:23,429
Must still be in
the roll-top in the old cabin.

1301
01:32:23,763 --> 01:32:26,015
Vernon's was encrusted with jewels.

1302
01:32:26,265 --> 01:32:29,518
Now's the time to buy it off him cheap.

1303
01:32:29,685 --> 01:32:33,439
We ain't getting married with
his ring. You said you'd changed.

1304
01:32:33,689 --> 01:32:36,192
- Just an old pewter thing.
- Ain't no wedding.

1305
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:38,861
- It's just a symbol, honey.
- No wedding.

1306
01:32:39,111 --> 01:32:40,529
We'll fetch it with you.

1307
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:43,699
It's just... Shut up, Delmar.
It's just a symbol.

1308
01:32:43,866 --> 01:32:47,453
I've spoken my piece and counted to three.

1309
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:51,374
She counted to three. God damn it.

1310
01:32:51,707 --> 01:32:54,543
She counted to three. Son of a bitch!

1311
01:32:54,794 --> 01:32:57,296
You have any idea how far that cabin is?

1312
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:15,481
George?

1313
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,316
Hello, boys!

1314
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:21,821
These little men finally
caught the criminal of the century.

1315
01:33:22,071 --> 01:33:24,156
Looks like the chair for George Nelson!

1316
01:33:24,407 --> 01:33:30,913
Yup, gonna electrify me.
I'm gonna go off like a roman candle!

1317
01:33:31,247 --> 01:33:34,667
20,000 volts chasing a rabbit
through yours truly!

1318
01:33:34,834 --> 01:33:38,587
Gonna suck all
the power right out of the state!

1319
01:33:38,838 --> 01:33:43,509
Gonna shoot sparks out of my head
and lightning from my fingertips!

1320
01:33:43,759 --> 01:33:48,097
I'm George Nelson,
and I'm feeling ten feet tall!

1321
01:33:48,347 --> 01:33:53,102
Looks like George
is right back on top again.

1322
01:33:53,352 --> 01:33:54,604
Cow killer!

1323
01:34:07,783 --> 01:34:11,454
Well, at least you boys get to see
the ancestral manse,

1324
01:34:11,787 --> 01:34:16,375
the home where I spent so many a
happy day in the bosom of my family

1325
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:19,795
refugin', if you will,
with a mighty oak tree out front

1326
01:34:20,129 --> 01:34:24,634
and a happy little tyre swing on it.

1327
01:34:28,054 --> 01:34:33,059
Where's the happy little tyre swing?

1328
01:34:33,559 --> 01:34:36,562
End of the road, boys.

1329
01:34:36,896 --> 01:34:38,981
- No. Wait a minute.
- Let's go, boys.

1330
01:34:39,231 --> 01:34:43,653
It's had its twists and turns,
now it deposits you here.

1331
01:34:43,986 --> 01:34:45,071
Wait a minute.

1332
01:34:45,321 --> 01:34:50,743
You have eluded fate and you have
eluded me for the last time.

1333
01:34:50,993 --> 01:34:53,996
- Tie their hands, boys.
- You can't do this, now.

1334
01:34:54,330 --> 01:34:57,166
Didn't know you'd be bringing a friend.

1335
01:34:57,333 --> 01:35:01,420
He'll just have to wait his turn,
share one of your graves.

1336
01:35:01,587 --> 01:35:05,091
You can't do it, we just got
pardoned by the governor.

1337
01:35:05,257 --> 01:35:09,345
- It went out on the radio.
- Is that right?

1338
01:35:12,348 --> 01:35:16,352
Well, we ain't got a radio.

1339
01:35:17,436 --> 01:35:21,357
God have mercy.

1340
01:35:24,527 --> 01:35:27,196
<i>You</i>

1341
01:35:27,363 --> 01:35:29,115
<i>Got to go</i>

1342
01:35:29,365 --> 01:35:32,201
<i>To that lonesome valley</i>

1343
01:35:32,368 --> 01:35:36,205
<i>You</i>

1344
01:35:36,455 --> 01:35:42,628
<i>Whoa, got...</i>

1345
01:35:42,795 --> 01:35:44,380
It ain't fittin'.

1346
01:35:44,547 --> 01:35:45,798
It ain't the law.

1347
01:35:46,132 --> 01:35:49,385
<i>- The law?
- To go...</i>

1348
01:35:49,552 --> 01:35:52,722
The law is a human institution.

1349
01:35:53,055 --> 01:35:56,559
<i>Nobody else</i>

1350
01:35:56,809 --> 01:35:59,562
<i>Can go there for you, no...</i>

1351
01:35:59,895 --> 01:36:02,815
Perhaps you should start
making your prayers.

1352
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:14,493
<i>Got</i>

1353
01:36:14,744 --> 01:36:16,412
<i>To go...</i>

1354
01:36:16,579 --> 01:36:21,000
Oh, my God. Everett?

1355
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:24,754
Tommy, I'm sorry we got you into this.

1356
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:28,674
Good Lord... What do we do?

1357
01:36:29,008 --> 01:36:35,014
<i>By yourself</i>

1358
01:36:38,768 --> 01:36:41,604
Oh, Lord...

1359
01:36:41,938 --> 01:36:46,859
Please look down
and recognise us poor sinners.

1360
01:36:48,361 --> 01:36:50,363
Please, Lord.

1361
01:36:50,696 --> 01:36:54,450
I just want to see my daughters again.

1362
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:58,704
I've been separated
from my family for so long.

1363
01:36:58,955 --> 01:37:02,291
I know I've been guilty of pride
and sharp dealing.

1364
01:37:02,458 --> 01:37:04,794
I'm sorry I turned my back on you,

1365
01:37:04,961 --> 01:37:07,880
forgive me.

1366
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:11,050
We're helpless, Lord.

1367
01:37:11,217 --> 01:37:14,804
For the sake of my family,
for Tommy's sake.

1368
01:37:14,971 --> 01:37:18,641
For Delmar's and Pete's.

1369
01:37:19,892 --> 01:37:23,980
Let me see my daughters again, Lord.

1370
01:37:24,397 --> 01:37:29,402
Help us, please.

1371
01:37:43,165 --> 01:37:47,336
<i>You got to go</i>

1372
01:37:47,503 --> 01:37:50,423
<i>To the lonesome valley</i>

1373
01:37:50,756 --> 01:37:57,763
<i>Yes, sir, you, whoa</i>

1374
01:38:00,266 --> 01:38:05,521
<i>Got</i>

1375
01:38:05,855 --> 01:38:10,860
<i>To go</i>

1376
01:38:11,110 --> 01:38:14,447
<i>There</i>

1377
01:38:16,949 --> 01:38:20,703
<i>By</i>

1378
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:23,372
<i>Yourself</i>

1379
01:38:23,623 --> 01:38:26,542
<i>Nobody else</i>

1380
01:38:26,709 --> 01:38:30,463
<i>Nobody else can go for you</i>

1381
01:38:30,713 --> 01:38:36,969
<i>You, whoa</i>

1382
01:38:39,221 --> 01:38:45,561
<i>Got</i>

1383
01:38:45,895 --> 01:38:49,982
<i>To go</i>

1384
01:38:50,316 --> 01:38:53,903
<i>There</i>

1385
01:38:56,572 --> 01:39:01,327
<i>By</i>

1386
01:39:01,577 --> 01:39:04,497
<i>Yourself</i>

1387
01:39:42,118 --> 01:39:45,955
- A miracle. It was a miracle!
- Delmar, don't be ignorant.

1388
01:39:46,205 --> 01:39:48,541
I told you they was flooding this valley.

1389
01:39:48,874 --> 01:39:52,211
- No! That ain't it!
- We prayed to God and he pitied us!

1390
01:39:52,461 --> 01:39:53,879
Well, it never fails.

1391
01:39:54,130 --> 01:39:57,717
Again, you hayseeds
are showin' you want for intellect.

1392
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:00,636
There's a perfectly
scientific explanation.

1393
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:04,223
That ain't the tune you was singin'
back at the gallows!

1394
01:40:04,557 --> 01:40:07,560
Any human being'll cast about
in a moment of stress.

1395
01:40:07,727 --> 01:40:09,729
No, they're flooding this valley

1396
01:40:09,979 --> 01:40:13,316
so they can hydroelectric
up the whole darn state.

1397
01:40:13,482 --> 01:40:16,402
Yes, sir, the south is gonna change.

1398
01:40:16,652 --> 01:40:19,405
Everything's gonna run on a paying basis.

1399
01:40:19,655 --> 01:40:23,993
Out with the spiritual mumbo-jumbo
and the backward ways.

1400
01:40:24,243 --> 01:40:29,415
We're gonna see a brave new world
where they hook us all up to a grid.

1401
01:40:29,749 --> 01:40:31,834
Yes, a veritable age of reason.

1402
01:40:32,084 --> 01:40:37,340
Like the one they had in France.
Not a moment too soon.

1403
01:40:40,426 --> 01:40:44,597
Not a moment too soon.

1404
01:40:44,847 --> 01:40:46,349
Hey, there's Tommy.

1405
01:40:46,515 --> 01:40:49,268
Tommy, what you ridin' there?

1406
01:40:52,772 --> 01:40:54,607
Roll-top desk.

1407
01:40:54,774 --> 01:41:01,364
<i>My latest sun is sinking fast</i>

1408
01:41:01,948 --> 01:41:03,866
<i>My race is nearly run...</i>

1409
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,786
"All's well that ends well",
some poet said.

1410
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:08,454
That's right, honey.

1411
01:41:08,788 --> 01:41:10,957
Don't mind telling you I'm awful pleased

1412
01:41:11,123 --> 01:41:13,793
my adventuring days have come to an end.

1413
01:41:14,043 --> 01:41:16,879
Time for this old boy
to enjoy some repose.

1414
01:41:17,129 --> 01:41:18,547
That's good, honey.

1415
01:41:18,798 --> 01:41:20,883
You were right about that ring, too.

1416
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:23,970
Any other wedding band wouldn't do.

1417
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,972
This here was fore-ordained.

1418
01:41:26,138 --> 01:41:27,974
Fate was a-smilin' on me.

1419
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:29,892
That's not my ring.

1420
01:41:30,142 --> 01:41:33,896
- What? Not your ring?
- That's one of Aunt Herlene's.

1421
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:37,150
- You said it was in the roll-top.
- I said I thought it was.

1422
01:41:37,233 --> 01:41:39,735
- No, you said...
- Or under the mattress.

1423
01:41:40,069 --> 01:41:41,737
Or maybe in my chifforobe.

1424
01:41:41,904 --> 01:41:44,657
Well, I'm sorry, honey.

1425
01:41:44,824 --> 01:41:46,158
We need that ring.

1426
01:41:46,492 --> 01:41:48,911
It's at the bottom of a durn big lake.

1427
01:41:49,245 --> 01:41:51,330
- Uh-uh.
- A 9,000 hectare lake.

1428
01:41:51,497 --> 01:41:55,084
I don't care if it's 90,000.
That lake was not my doing.

1429
01:41:55,251 --> 01:41:58,421
- I've counted to three.
- No, wait, honey.

1430
01:41:58,671 --> 01:42:01,507
Finding one ring
in the middle of all that water

1431
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:08,264
<i>- is one hell of a heroic task!
- ...And gives me victory</i>

1432
01:42:08,598 --> 01:42:13,603
<i>O, come, angel band</i>

1433
01:42:13,853 --> 01:42:15,688
<i>Come and</i>

1434
01:42:16,022 --> 01:42:18,524
<i>Around me stand</i>

1435
01:42:18,691 --> 01:42:23,529
<i>O, bear me away on your snow white wings</i>

1436
01:42:23,863 --> 01:42:29,035
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1437
01:42:29,285 --> 01:42:34,373
<i>O, bear me away on your snow white wings</i>

1438
01:42:34,707 --> 01:42:41,714
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1439
01:42:48,471 --> 01:42:54,310
<i>My latest sun is sinking fast</i>

1440
01:42:54,560 --> 01:43:00,149
<i>My race is nearly run</i>

1441
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:06,405
<i>My strongest trials now are past</i>

1442
01:43:06,572 --> 01:43:12,411
<i>My triumph has begun</i>

1443
01:43:12,828 --> 01:43:15,831
<i>O, come</i>

1444
01:43:16,165 --> 01:43:18,751
<i>Angel band</i>

1445
01:43:19,001 --> 01:43:24,173
<i>Come and around me stand</i>

1446
01:43:24,507 --> 01:43:29,929
<i>O, bear me away on your snow white wings</i>

1447
01:43:30,179 --> 01:43:35,768
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1448
01:43:36,102 --> 01:43:41,524
<i>O, bear me away on your snow white wings</i>

1449
01:43:41,691 --> 01:43:47,697
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1450
01:43:54,537 --> 01:44:00,376
<i>O, bear my longin' heart to him</i>

1451
01:44:00,626 --> 01:44:06,215
<i>Who bled and died for me</i>

1452
01:44:06,549 --> 01:44:12,471
<i>Whose blood now cleanses from all sin</i>

1453
01:44:12,722 --> 01:44:18,728
<i>And gives me victory</i>

1454
01:44:18,978 --> 01:44:21,731
<i>O, come</i>

1455
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:24,567
<i>Angel band</i>

1456
01:44:24,817 --> 01:44:29,905
<i>Come and around me stand</i>

1457
01:44:30,072 --> 01:44:35,745
<i>O, bear me away on your snow white wings</i>

1458
01:44:36,078 --> 01:44:41,584
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1459
01:44:41,751 --> 01:44:47,423
<i>O, bear me away on your snow white wings</i>

1460
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:54,597
<i>To my immortal home</i>

1461
01:45:14,116 --> 01:45:18,621
<i>There's a dark and a troubled side of life</i>

1462
01:45:18,788 --> 01:45:22,959
<i>There's a bright and a sunny side, too</i>

1463
01:45:23,292 --> 01:45:27,630
<i>Though we meet with darkness and strife</i>

1464
01:45:27,964 --> 01:45:32,385
<i>The sunny side be also with you</i>

1465
01:45:32,551 --> 01:45:34,553
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

1466
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,639
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

1467
01:45:36,806 --> 01:45:40,559
<i>Keep on the sunny side of life</i>

1468
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:42,812
<i>It will help us every day</i>

1469
01:45:42,979 --> 01:45:45,064
<i>It will brighten all the way</i>

1470
01:45:45,314 --> 01:45:50,903
<i>If we'll keep on the sunny side of life</i>

1471
01:46:07,253 --> 01:46:11,591
<i>The storm and its fury broke today</i>

1472
01:46:11,757 --> 01:46:15,761
<i>Crushing hopes that we cherished so dear</i>

1473
01:46:15,928 --> 01:46:20,016
<i>Clouds and storms again will pass away</i>

1474
01:46:20,349 --> 01:46:25,104
<i>And the sun will shine again,
bright and clear</i>

1475
01:46:25,354 --> 01:46:27,189
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

1476

<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

1477
01:46:29,609 --> 01:46:33,362
<i>Keep on the sunny side of life</i>

1478
01:46:33,529 --> 01:46:35,448
<i>It will help us every day</i>

1479
01:46:35,615 --> 01:46:37,617
<i>It will brighten all the way</i>

1480
01:46:37,867 --> 01:46:42,538
<i>If we'll keep on the sunny side of life</i>

1481
01:46:42,872 --> 01:46:44,790
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

1482
01:46:45,124 --> 01:46:47,043
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

1483
01:46:47,209 --> 01:46:50,796
<i>Keep on the sunny side of life</i>

1484
01:46:51,047 --> 01:46:53,049
<i>It will help us every day</i>

1485
01:46:53,299 --> 01:46:55,384
<i>It will brighten all the way</i>

1486
01:46:55,551 --> 01:46:59,722
<i>If we'll keep on the sunny side of life</i>

1487
01:47:00,056 --> 01:47:05,811
<i>If we'll keep on the sunny side of life</i>

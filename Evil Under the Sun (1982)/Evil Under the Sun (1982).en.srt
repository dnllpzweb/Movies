1
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:52,001
Please, please, you must come quick.

2
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:54,626
There's a woman
lying dead out on the moors.

3
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:06,459
It's all right, Miss.
No need for you to take another look.

4
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,709
Ruber, Alice. Mrs.

5
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,876
I'd say she's been dead
for no more than two hours.

6
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:18,417
Say four o'clock at the outside
for time of death.

7
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:33,917
Hercules Parrot, sir.

8
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:38,667
"Poirot", mademoiselle. Pucker your lips
as though about to bestow a kiss!

9
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,542
- "Poi-rot".
- Morning, Poirot,

10
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:44,367
I hope you have good news. This case
has been hanging fire for four months.

11
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:47,084
No, I'm afraid
it's one of those rare cases

12
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,501
where an insurance company must, er...

13
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,792
...laugh and lump it.

14
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,209
Oh, well.

15
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:02,126
The usual 100 guineas, I take it?

16
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,251
Er, by the way, Poirot...
Take a look at this.

17
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,501
It is the property of Sir Horace Blatt.

18
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,459
He is seeking
to insure it with us for £50,000.

19
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:22,167
Well, on the face of it, it seems to be
worth every penny of, er...

20
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:26,751
38 pounds, seven shillings and sixpence.

21
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:30,626
You are of course quite right.
It is paste.

22
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:35,042
The question is,
why should a millionaire industrialist

23
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:38,334
- perpetrate such an obvious fraud?
- Precisely.

24
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,417
He must have known
the stone would be examined.

25
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,626
So you see...
there is something of a mystery.

26
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:49,417
Rest assured, with Hercule Poirot
mysteries never last for long.

27
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,876
Oh. Exactly.

28
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,876
So, we were wondering if you would
undertake to investigate the matter.

29
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,917
You know that you can count
on my discretion.

30
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:03,792
Very well. I will see Sir Horace, er...
this afternoon.

31
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:06,209
Hardly this afternoon, I think.

32
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:09,292
He's on his yacht, the Jolly Roger,
in the south of France.

33
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,584
Would a further £200 meet the case?

34
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:15,501
Guineas.

35
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:20,042
It will make my forthcoming holidays
even more attractive.

36
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,917
So that's your game, is it?

37
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,292
You come out here and as near as dammit

38
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:51,042
accuse me, Horace Blatt, of fraud?

39
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,876
Do you seriously think
that I'd cheat the insurance company

40
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,584
over one bloody jewel?

41
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,459
I am worth millions, Poirot.

42
00:05:57,584 --> 00:06:01,167
Nevertheless, I'm afraid
it's quite worthless, monsieur.

43
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,126
God, I could wring her bloody neck!

44
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:09,709
If you would care to confide in me,
I should be most honoured.

45
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:13,167
All right, I'll tell you this much.

46
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:16,876
A couple of months back,
I met a certain lady in New York.

47
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,667
She told me she was
so madly in love with me

48
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:22,959
that she'd leave the show she was in...
She was an actress, you know?

49
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,876
...and come back to England with me
on the Queen Mary and marry me.

50
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,042
So I bought her this stone from Tiffany's.

51
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,709
Halfway across the Atlantic, she changed
her mind and ran off with another man.

52
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,751
Well, I wouldn't have minded so much,
only she took the jewel with her.

53
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,501
You see, that wasn't a fair do.

54
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,959
You see, I had given her it
in contemplation of marriage.

55
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:43,334
And, frankly, $100,000
is a bit much to pay

56
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,626
for three days' fumbling on the high seas.

57
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:49,292
Oh, monsieur, who can put a price
on <i>Les affaires Du cœur</i>?

58
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:50,667
Well, I bloody can.

59
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,584
And this was too high.

60
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,917
So, three weeks ago,
I went after her and demanded it back.

61
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,834
Of course she tried to put me off,

62
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,168
but finally after a week or so,
she gave it to me

63
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:02,001
and I sent it along to be insured

64
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:05,084
and, er, she'd had the bloody thing
copied, hadn't she?

65
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,584
It would appear to be
the only explanation, monsieur.

66
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,959
Well, she's not gonna make
a chump out of me.

67
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:14,334
I happen to know that in three days' time

68
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,109
she'll be down at Daphne's place
for a little holiday.

69
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,376
I'll give her a little holiday!

70
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:21,876
Daphne's place?

71
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:25,626
Yes, you know, Daphne Castle.

72
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:30,209
Yes, she... she was a mistress
of the King of Tyrania for years.

73
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:33,209
Then when he upped
and married the present queen,

74
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:36,376
he gave Daphne an old summer palace
to keep her quiet.

75
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:39,917
She's turned it into one
of those exclusive la-di-da hotels

76
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,876
where the nobs and nancies
come to squawk at each other.

77
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:45,292
I can't stand it meself,
but she's good sort.

78
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:46,876
Anyway, you'd better come with me.

79
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,501
I'll have the captain prepare a cabin.
We can sail tonight.

80
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,876
Er, alas, monsieur.

81
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:54,834
Ever since I was a small boy,
I have suffered from <i>le mal de mer.</i>

82
00:07:57,334 --> 00:08:00,626
It needed all my courage
to make this small trip.

83
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:03,459
Oh.

84
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:06,626
I will take the train and join you there.

85
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:16,084
<i>Mes compliments à Monsieur Jerome.</i>

86
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,626
Waiter?

87
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,042
Could I have another brandy
and the bill, please?

88
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,501
Patrick! You haven't got time
for another drink!

89
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:28,042
- The steamer leaves at 11:00.
- Of course I have

90
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,751
if you have the baggage sent down
while I wait for the change.

91
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,334
Why do I always have to do everything?

92
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,667
- Monsieur Poirot...
- Hm?

93
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:41,667
Your reservation on the night train
has been confirmed.

94
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,376
The tickets will be at the desk, monsieur.

95
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,251
Thank you. Er...

96
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,542
I must go.

97
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,001
I've got to catch that damn boat.

98
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:40,376
What on earth's wrong, Rex?
You look fearfully glum.

99
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:43,251
You're supposed to be enjoying yourself.

100
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:46,876
- God knows you're paying enough for it.
- Huh! Don't I know it?

101
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:48,834
As a matter of fact, Daphne,

102
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,209
I was wondering
if you would care to trade my bill

103
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:55,042
for a super piece in the "New Yorker"?

104
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,959
You know the sort of thing.
"Farewell, courtesan. Hello, innkeeper."

105
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:03,167
Darling, I'd love to help, but it's
not publicity I need, it's the cash.

106
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,084
Oh, good God, darling, don't we all?

107
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,376
How are the Gardeners this morning?

108
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:11,626
"Age cannot wither, nor custom stale,
their infinite vulgarity."

109
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:14,709
Morning, Gardeners.
Everything tickety-boo?

110
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,126
- Good morning.
- Sure, Daphne,

111
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:20,251
but I could wish that my shower
worked as snappily

112
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:22,668
as the one that I've got back home
in New York City.

113
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:25,668
You can't expect American plumbing
when you're in the Adriatic.

114
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,876
I guess not.
Well, at least we've got a shower.

115
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:32,917
A cousin of Odell's was at some place
in Yugoslavia last year

116
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:35,792
and had to wash
in a kind of shack in a field.

117
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,251
Isn't that so, Odell?

118
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:40,626
It wasn't my cousin, Myra, it was my aunt.

119
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:42,751
It was your cousin, Thelma Snatchball.

120
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,501
OK, if you insist.
But there were two shacks.

121
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:49,876
One for the guests and one for the staff.
It was very stylish.

122
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:53,834
Boat's coming in, Daphne.
Prepare to repel boarders.

123
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:56,376
That'll be Arlena.

124
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,542
Do you mean Arlena Stuart?

125
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:02,709
No, no. Arlena Marshall.
She remarried a couple of months ago.

126
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,251
Oh, good God, darling.
I didn't know she was coming.

127
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:06,834
Oh, how marvellous!

128
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,543
I am her greatest fan.
It will just make my vacation.

129
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:13,417
Did any of you happen to see that
last show of hers, "Hail and Farewell"?

130
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:19,917
We produced it.

131
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,834
Remember, dear?

132
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,959
Oh, good God, darlings!
I plumb forgot.

133
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:29,126
Isn't that the one that she walked out on

134
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:32,626
after just three weeks
and your biggest hit in years?

135
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:35,042
You know damn well it was.

136
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:38,667
And just what was that?
A sudden breakdown in health?

137
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,751
More like a sudden attack of gold digging.

138
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:46,042
Which rather turned it
into "Sail and Farewell", eh?

139
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,834
Funny man. Mmh.

140
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:55,251
Well, if that's Arlena,

141
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:58,251
she must be being dressed
by Woolworths these days.

142
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,751
Oh, that's...
That's the Redferns.

143
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:04,334
Patrick and Christine, I seem to remember.

144
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:07,292
Excuse me.
I must put my hostess hat on.

145
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:10,626
Anyway, darlings,
it must have cost you a pretty bundle

146
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,876
closing a hit show like that.

147
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,834
Would either of you
care to comment on that?

148
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,626
Why don't you go and play with yourself?

149
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:17,709
Excessively.

150
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:22,959
Is coarseness a substitute for wit,
I ask myself?

151
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,959
Hello!

152
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:28,709
I'm Daphne Castle.
Welcome to the island.

153
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,834
- How do you do?
- Looks lovely.

154
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,292
- I'm sure we'll have a nice time here.
- Oh!

155
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:36,792
And a naughty one, too, I hope.

156
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:39,334
- Would you care to sign in?
- Naughty?

157
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,126
Yes, what are the holidays for,

158
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:44,001
if you can't do a spot of flirting
and get a bit pissyboos?

159
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:47,534
Quite right. Do you fancy a walk
around the island before lunch, dear?

160
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:48,959
Patrick!

161
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:53,084
You know I've got a splitting headache
and I've got all the unpacking to do.

162
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:56,084
Andreas will show you to your room,
if you like.

163
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,584
Thank you.

164
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,834
After two days on that suffocating steamer

165
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,417
I would have really thought that
you'd have more consideration for me.

166
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,742
Anyway, I'm no good
at clambering over rocks.

167
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,209
<i>Ah, non, monsieur...</i>

168
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:18,334
<i>Je vous ai déjà payé!</i>

169
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,584
<i>Oh, c'est la dernière fois!
Voilà!</i>

170
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:45,084
Thank you for those three hours
of pure and unadulterated hell.

171
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,126
This may come as a nasty surprise to you,

172
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,334
but shock absorbers have been standard
equipment on motorised vehicles

173
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,834
for 30 years!

174
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:05,126
Stop playing <i>boules</i> with my Vuitton!

175
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:07,251
Linda, you gormless oaf, do something!

176
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:08,709
Like what?

177
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:11,501
Like stop them, cretin!

178
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:13,251
Kenneth, this is a nightmare.

179
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:15,584
Take it easy, Arlena.
We'll soon be there.

180
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,667
Soon can't be soon enough for me.

181
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:20,417
Of all the rancidly dreadful journeys...

182
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:27,001
Isn't that the absurd little man
we saw in the station at Tirana,

183
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:29,834
the one who pinched the only decent taxi
from under your nose?

184
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,751
Yes, I do believe it is.

185
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,001
Good morning.

186
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:41,917
Since we are all going to Daphne's island,
I'd better introduce myself.

187
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:44,917
I'm Kenneth Marshall
and this is my wife, Arlena.

188
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:47,417
- Hercule Poirot. <i>Enchanté,</i> madame.
- Charmed.

189
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,376
And this is my stepdaughter, Linda.

190
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:54,168
Do stop standing there like a cough drop
and say good morning to Monsieur Poirot.

191
00:14:54,251 --> 00:14:55,918
- Morning.
<i>- Bonjour, mademoiselle.</i>

192
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:59,084
Was your journey as frightful as ours,
Monsieur Poirot?

193
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,042
Alas, I fear the sea
more than the land, madame.

194
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,042
Oh, Mr Marshall,
I implore you not to spoil them.

195
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,217
We'll have to pay double on the way home.

196
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:11,042
It's only a 20-minute boat trip.

197
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,084
You'll find it all worthwhile
once we get to the island, I assure you.

198
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,876
You mean you've been there before?

199
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:18,709
Yes, I was there
for a few days three years ago.

200
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,001
After the death of my first wife.

201
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,084
God's teeth!

202
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:39,084
Don't worry, darling.
It's only the noonday gun.

203
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:41,084
The noonday gun?

204
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,459
Yes, it's fired every day at 12 o'clock

205
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:47,709
to commemorate the glorious victory
of Kosovo Metohija in 1193.

206
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:52,459
I'm reliably informed
that a mere handful of Tyranian cavalry

207
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,834
routed over 50,000
barbarous Bosnian fanatics.

208
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,309
It was apparently the only
military success in their entire history.

209
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,334
One success too many.

210
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:21,834
Arlena! Arlena, darling, I love you!

211
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:47,959
That tub was even more
uncomfortable than that damned taxi.

212
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:58,001
What if the bitch refuses to do the show?

213
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:00,376
We'll lose all our backers,
that's what, Myra.

214
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,709
After all, we sell the show on her name.

215
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:06,751
To think our futures are riding
on that snake-eyed hussy!

216
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:17,542
Welcome to the island, everybody!

217
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,959
Kenneth, oh, it's...
it's marvellous to see you!

218
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,792
Absolutely marvellous.

219
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,793
It must be at least two years
since you were last on the island.

220
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:29,376
It's three, actually.
Wonderful to be here.

221
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:32,126
- You never met Linda, did you?
- No!

222
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,209
No, I didn't. Hello! Hello, Linda.
Welcome to the island.

223
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:39,792
And... I don't think you know Arlena.

224
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,792
Oh! Oh, yes.

225
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,667
Yes, I do.

226
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,042
Arlena and I are old sparring partners.

227
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,626
Hello, Daphne.

228
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,917
Oh, it's been years.

229
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:56,626
Well, a little time, yes.

230
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:58,334
Years.

231
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:02,501
Arlena and I were in the chorus
of a show together,

232
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:04,751
not that I could ever compete.

233
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:08,334
Even in those days, she could always
throw her legs up in the air

234
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,251
higher than any of us.

235
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,792
And wider.

236
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:15,959
Kenneth, this is such a surprise.

237
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:19,542
When you told me of an island
run by a quaint little landlady,

238
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,709
I had no idea it was Daphne Castle.

239
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:25,917
Yes, quite. Er... Daphne,
I wonder if we could go to our rooms.

240
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,542
It's been a long journey.

241
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,876
Oh. Certainly.

242
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,042
Andreas!

243
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:48,376
If you're short-staffed,
Kenneth can easily carry the bags.

244
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,667
They'll be brought up in a minute.

245
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,709
There'll be cocktails tonight
at eight o'clock.

246
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:58,751
Do have a good,
long, peaceful rest, Arlena.

247
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:10,334
Oh, you, you must be
Sir Horace Blatt's friend.

248
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:12,876
Perhaps... Perhaps you'll sign in.

249
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,501
Oh, so you're the famous
Hercule Poirot, eh?

250
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,084
- Er, you are too amiable, madame.
- Perhaps.

251
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:35,501
I hope you haven't come here to practice
your sleuthing games on my guests.

252
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:38,126
They've got far too many skeletons
in their cupboards

253
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,667
to join in with enthusiasm.

254
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:43,167
It's not my intention
to derange you or your guests, madame.

255
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:46,417
<i>Pendant Les vacances,</i>
my desires are simply a good valet,

256
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:52,251
a... <i>tisane de menthe poivrée</i>
at eight o'clock in the morning precisely,

257
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:56,876
and of course some wax,
some beeswax for my shoes.

258
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,542
That's all.

259
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:03,084
Actually, Gilbert had nothing to do
with the success this season.

260
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:07,209
Oh, my God, I really don't know
what we are going to do about them.

261
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:10,459
I really do think that the Millers
have gone too far.

262
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,376
- Gilly is my oldest friend, Rex.
- Oh, God, darling, I didn't know that!

263
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:18,167
- Gilly is Myra's oldest friend.
- I just told him, Odell.

264
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:21,792
Did you hear what Gilbert
said about the Queen?

265
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,251
No.

266
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:25,417
Gilbert said to a friend of his,

267
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:29,542
"Do you know
what the Queen calls Kitty?"

268
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:35,334
- Hello, Linda. Have one?
- Thanks.

269
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:36,751
Are you enjoying it?

270
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:39,001
I couldn't have one.
This was delicious...

271
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:41,084
- Oh, I can get you some.
- Thank you.

272
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:44,584
How about a cocktail, Monsieur Poirot?

273
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:47,876
Er, White Lady, a Sidecar,
Mainbrace or Between the Sheets?

274
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:52,292
No, if I could have a <i>crème de cassis</i>
or a <i>sirop de banane.</i>

275
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,417
Do you have banana syrup?

276
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:56,751
Certainly.

277
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:58,417
Oh, my!

278
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,667
I'm the last to arrive!

279
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,792
Have a sausage, dear.

280
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,334
You must be famished,
having to wait all that time in your room.

281
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:11,709
Er, have you...
have you met the Redferns?

282
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:14,001
Christine and Patrick.

283
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:17,792
- Arlena, darling.
- Arlena, my favourite leading lady!

284
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:22,167
Why, if it isn't Odell and Myra!

285
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:24,209
What on earth are you two doing here?

286
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:27,584
It's wonderful to see you, Arlena.
We have a fabulous show for you.

287
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,834
Oh, it's a real humdinger, honey.

288
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:33,209
And Odell insisted that we both
come over here together

289
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,959
to see you personally.

290
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:39,376
Well, it's very sweet of you,
but I'm sort of retired, you know?

291
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:41,876
This is my new audience.

292
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,959
- Have you met my husband?
- How do you do?

293
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:47,709
How do you do? You'll change your mind.
You won't be able to resist this one.

294
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:49,084
Keeler's mad to do it,

295
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:51,959
but we're holding her off
until you have a chance to look at it.

296
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,834
And Kern, he's done
some of the best music...

297
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:57,167
Arlena, darling,
it's simply sensational to see you again!

298
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:59,842
- Hello, Rex.
- How do you do? I'm Kenneth Marshall.

299
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,501
Excuse me.
I must talk to you, Arlena darling.

300
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:05,042
Not now, Rexy-poo.

301
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,751
Thank you.

302
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:08,209
Cheers.

303
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:52,126
Good morning, Linda.

304
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:53,959
How is your lovely mother?

305
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:56,501
She's not lovely and she's not my mother.

306
00:22:58,084 --> 00:23:00,917
Darling, didn't anyone ever tell you

307
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:03,792
that peevishness is unbecoming
in young ladies?

308
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,334
No.

309
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:08,042
But they told me
not to talk to very strange men.

310
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:12,292
Morning, Gardeners!

311
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,834
- Morning.
- Oh, good morning, Arlena.

312
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:22,417
I think it's gonna be a hot day.

313
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,417
Good morning, Mrs Redfern.

314
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:31,751
- Well, well, she's in wonderful shape.
- Yeah.

315
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:35,459
How much was it we paid Kleinfield,
Klausewitz and Stummerhoppen

316
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:38,001
to contest that phoney
doctor's certificate?

317
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,501
$20,000.

318
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,834
Arlena, darling,
you look quite divine in that outfit.

319
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:46,542
Say no more. It's yours. Next question?

320
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:49,043
There is something quite important
I have to talk to you about.

321
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:51,334
- So talk.
- It's a bit private.

322
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,209
You heard the little man, Linda.

323
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:54,876
Scram!

324
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:00,126
Well, what is it?

325
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:02,751
Arlena, I was wondering
if you've had a chance

326
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,793
to read the proofs of the biography yet?

327
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,293
Indeed I have, Rex.
I simply couldn't put it down.

328
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:09,126
I knew, I knew you'd love it.

329
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:13,292
What a busy bee. You've been
researching exactly where I was born...

330
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,417
and when!

331
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,459
Well, darling, there aren't too many stars

332
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,209
who were born in Tooting Bec
at the turn of the century.

333
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,209
And the sweet way you wrote
about how I landed my first leading role

334
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:24,167
in "Flames of Eternity".

335
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:26,667
- However did you find out?
- I bribed his wife.

336
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:29,042
Naughty Rex!

337
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,667
- Ah, the days of my youth.
- Mm-hm.

338
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,834
But I've shoved all that
behind me now, Rex,

339
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:36,793
which is exactly what you're going to do
with your lousy book.

340
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,709
But, Arlena darling, you promised.
When we were in New York.

341
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:43,167
And I've spent the advance.
I simply must have that release.

342
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:47,042
Forget it. You're not going to barbecue
me to keep yourself in sailor suits.

343
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,584
But, Arlena...

344
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:53,667
- Angel, you must.
- I said forget it.

345
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,342
I'm not going to sign that release
and that's final.

346
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:01,334
You're going to regret this, Arlena.

347
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,084
That's a promise.

348
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,209
Good morning, Mrs Marshall.

349
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,959
Good morning, Mr Brewster.

350
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:25,417
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

351
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:29,251
Oh, Linda, what are doing here?
Acting as chaperone, gooseberry or spy?

352
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:30,709
I just wanted a chat.

353
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:32,584
I don't seem to be having much fun.

354
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:36,876
Well, if it's fun you're looking for,
darling, go play with the jellyfish.

355
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:43,042
Oh, my God.
She runs like a dromedary with dropsy.

356
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,834
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

357
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,417
Monsieur Poirot.

358
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:55,376
Bitch!

359
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,459
No, no, put me down!

360
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:02,292
Whoo! Put me down!

361
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:05,167
Put me down! No, no, no, no!

362
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:09,334
I shall cry! I shall, I shall cry!

363
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:19,251
You do not care for the aquatic sports
or the sunbathing, madame?

364
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:22,417
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't go brown.

365
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,167
I sort of resemble a cassata.

366
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:27,417
Pink skin, white blisters
and green in the face.

367
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,917
Unlike your husband, I observe.

368
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:32,667
No, he manages those things rather well.

369
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,626
Sometimes I think
he must think I'm an awful goose.

370
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:38,751
But why, madame?
I do not indulge in those sports myself

371
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:41,584
and yet I assure you
I am very far from being...

372
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,334
...a goose.

373
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:45,834
Oh, there you are, Monsieur Poirot.

374
00:26:58,126 --> 00:27:01,334
I've just had a telephone call
from your friend, Sir Horace.

375
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:04,584
He says he's having trouble
with his... his piffle valve.

376
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:08,626
Such a valve
still has to be invented, madame.

377
00:27:08,751 --> 00:27:11,293
Oh, well, I dare say you're right.
I wasn't paying attention.

378
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:13,626
Anyway, the result is,
he'll be 24 hours late.

379
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,334
Good morning, Kenneth.

380
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:23,584
Are you going for a swim?

381
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:26,626
The water is so hot,
the lobsters are coming out red.

382
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:28,334
Good morning.

383
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:31,359
Come along, Daddy.
You promised to come for a walk with me.

384
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,751
Patrick...

385
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:29,026
Aren't you getting
a little tired of rowing?

386
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:42,667
That was last night.
And this morning he starts...

387
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:44,376
Andre... Andre... I don't...

388
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:47,751
I don't care if Monsieur Poirot
wants cement on his sausages

389
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:50,917
or boot-blacking on his butter,
just give it to him!

390
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:54,709
That finicky little Belgian fart
will find it all on his bill anyhow.

391
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,859
- With a vengeance!
- Oh, very well, madame.

392
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,376
I'm so sorry. Are we late?

393
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:07,959
Patrick insisted upon rowing me
right around the island.

394
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,334
It's much bigger than I thought.

395
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:12,417
- Poor darling, he's exhausted.
- Not in the least surprised.

396
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,834
I'm sorry we didn't take you
with us, my dear.

397
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:17,209
The sun would have been
much too strong for you.

398
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,834
You know that.

399
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:25,792
Arlena, here you are.
It's the script that I promised you.

400
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:29,209
No, dear, I thought I told you last night.
I've given up the theatre.

401
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:31,709
These two are all I'm concerned with now.

402
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:36,792
- What's it called anyway?
- "It's Not Right And It's Not Fair."

403
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:38,667
Sounds like a black man's left leg.

404
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:04,584
It's all right, Mr Poirot.

405
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:07,042
<i>Oh, pardon, madame.
Je m'excuse.</i>

406
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,834
Please stay.

407
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:16,417
I'm just being silly.

408
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,792
I wish I had more self-control.

409
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:20,417
Didn't show what I feel.

410
00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:24,792
Well, that is sometimes not easy
for the ladies.

411
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,459
Do you know
what I'm most sick of in this place?

412
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:29,959
- What, madame?
- Pity.

413
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:31,876
I can't bear to be pitied.

414
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:36,001
Everyone round here
seems to feel so sorry for me.

415
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:38,176
I can tell it by the way they look at me.

416
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:41,751
"Poor little thing", they're saying.

417
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:45,426
"What she has to put up with,
with that poor fool of a husband of hers."

418
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:49,667
"What a pity she's not strong enough
to compete for what she wants."

419
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:53,084
Will you allow me
to tell you something, madame?

420
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:57,084
The Arlena Stuarts of this world
do not count.

421
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,667
Their domination is of the moment.

422
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:05,751
Really to count a woman
must have either goodness or brains.

423
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:10,126
You can't actually believe that men
care for either of those things, can you?

424
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,084
Oh, yes, I do, madame.

425
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,751
Your husband loves you.

426
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:17,501
I know that.

427
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:23,584
Come, let us take
a little promenade. Hm?

428
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:26,084
Ah.

429
00:32:42,084 --> 00:32:43,959
Oh, I wish I could do that.

430
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:45,584
Just lie in the sun.

431
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:47,334
<i>Mais pourquoi, madame?</i>

432
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:51,042
Look at them lying in rows,
like corpses in the morgue!

433
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:54,293
They are not men and women.
There's nothing personal about them.

434
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:59,167
They're just bodies, butcher's meat,
steaks grilling in the sun.

435
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:05,167
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Poirot,
but I suffer from vertigo.

436
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:08,251
I can't bear to look down from a height.

437
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:11,626
I'm better now.
In fact, I am determined to enjoy myself.

438
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:14,959
It's so blissful here. So tranquil.

439
00:33:15,084 --> 00:33:17,542
So far from all violence and trouble.

440
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:21,626
Yes, you are right, madame.

441
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:25,334
The sky is blue, the sun is shining

442
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:28,376
and yet you forget that everywhere...

443
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:31,084
there is evil under the sun.

444
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:03,626
You're going to be late for dinner,
you know?

445
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,584
Yes, I know.

446
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,292
Just having a bit of a think.

447
00:34:08,084 --> 00:34:09,917
About Arlena?

448
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:14,209
I suppose it's no use
saying it's your own fault.

449
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:17,334
- Not much.
- No, it never is.

450
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:21,168
How about, "You've made your bed,
now you must lie on it"?

451
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:23,459
- Worse.
- Thought it might be.

452
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:26,584
Poor Kenneth. You do pick 'em.

453
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:28,459
Oh, I can cope.

454
00:34:28,584 --> 00:34:30,784
- Do you think Linda can?
- What do you mean?

455
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:35,376
She's always on at that poor child,
bitching the hell out of her.

456
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:37,667
Yes. Yes, a pity about that.

457
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:42,126
Linda's like... like her mother, you see.
She takes things hard.

458
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:44,168
Then why don't you do something about it?

459
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,793
- Like what?
- Like fixing up a divorce, for instance.

460
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,334
People do it all the time.

461
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:51,251
With most of my friends
it's almost a full-time occupation.

462
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:54,709
Arlena's all right.
She just adores to flirt, that's all.

463
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,418
There's nothing in it.
It's all on the spur of the moment.

464
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:59,001
Spur of the moment?

465
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:01,959
You really are blind.

466
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:06,376
Who the hell do you think booked Patrick
Redfern in here in the first place?

467
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:08,667
You don't mean...?

468
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:11,542
I'm afraid so.

469
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:18,501
Even so. With me a deal is a deal.

470
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:21,334
I don't approve of quick marriage
and easy divorce.

471
00:35:21,459 --> 00:35:24,042
Arlena is my wife.
That's all there is to it.

472
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:27,667
Till death do you part?

473
00:35:29,334 --> 00:35:30,792
Exactly.

474
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:34,251
I see.

475
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:44,417
Well?

476
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:52,167
I could just kill that cow!

477
00:35:58,001 --> 00:36:00,834
Well, what the hell do we do now, Odell?

478
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,792
Just leave it to me.

479
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:05,917
- I'll think of something.
- Hm!

480
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:07,709
My hero!

481
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:12,126
I swear, if you were a man,
I would divorce you.

482
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:17,876
Hello, darling!
You'd better get a move on.

483
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,542
Where have you been?

484
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,626
I've just been having a word with Daphne.

485
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,751
Mm. You get on like a house on fire
with her, don't you?

486
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,042
She's a nice lady.

487
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,917
Yes, I suppose she is.

488
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:32,209
As hotel proprietors go.

489
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:39,751
And you get on rather well with Redfern,
don't you?

490
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,251
He's a nice fellow.

491
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:45,751
Yes, I suppose he is, as gigolos go.

492
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:48,417
What's that supposed to mean?

493
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,001
You liked him well enough
when you met him in London.

494
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,001
I've never set eyes on the man before.

495
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:54,501
Really?

496
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:56,626
I could have sworn you were there.

497
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:59,168
It must have been the night of
your regimental dinner.

498
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,876
Well, anyway, what does it matter?

499
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:03,876
He just happens to be a guest here
who took me for a boat ride, that's all.

500
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:06,876
He just happens
to be a guest here, Arlena,

501
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:09,051
because you just happened to book him in.

502
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:12,251
The bitch Daphne!

503
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:20,417
I refuse to talk about it!

504
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:22,417
You don't want to talk about it.

505
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:24,084
Oh, look here, Christine.

506
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:27,626
I can't even speak to a pretty woman
without you jumping to the conclusion

507
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:29,459
that I'm having an affair with her!

508
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:32,667
Aren't you? You leave me
here alone and go off with her.

509
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,376
I'm the laughing stock of the whole hotel.

510
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,959
Of course you're not!
You're being ridiculous!

511
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:39,384
Arlena and I are just good friends,
that's all!

512
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:42,459
I don't believe you!
Please, let's just go away.

513
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:45,501
No, I absolutely refuse.
Here we are and here we stay!

514
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:48,626
- If you don't like it, then you can...
- Yes, what can I do?

515
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:59,209
Well, I'm looking forward to having
a nice little chat with you, Patrick.

516
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:01,917
Oh, Myra, that is so beautiful.

517
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:04,417
- How's your drink?
- Incredible.

518
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:11,709
- How are you?
- Darling...

519
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,417
- Too much sun?
- Good!

520
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,501
Hmm.

521
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:40,626
Good.

522
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:44,167
That's enough, Linda.
It's adult time.

523
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:46,376
- Off to bed.
- Come on, darling. Let her stay.

524
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:47,959
She is on holiday after all.

525
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:50,167
Scram, Cinderella.

526
00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:25,834
That was terrific!

527
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:28,001
Isn't she wonderful?

528
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:30,376
Wonderful! Wonderful!

529
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,001
Truly!

530
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:53,001
Mademoiselle!

531
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:20,709
Abracadabra!

532
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:27,376
I know how you did that.

533
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:28,959
The egg's in your top pocket.

534
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:33,209
I'm not five years old, you know?

535
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,084
Been for a bathe, darling?

536
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:45,667
What's it look like?

537
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:48,917
Darling, there is no need to be snappy

538
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:51,842
just because you went to bed
bright and early last night.

539
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:04,567
I always keep mine behind my ear.

540
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:07,501
What?

541
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:10,709
Hm.

542
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:17,876
Oh, there you are!

543
00:42:18,459 --> 00:42:19,543
I was looking for you.

544
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:22,501
I'm going sketching at Gull Cove.
Would you like to come?

545
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,168
- Yes, I'd love to.
- All right.

546
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,626
I'll see you down in the hall
in ten minutes.

547
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:29,542
Ah, hello, Mr Poirot.

548
00:42:57,126 --> 00:43:01,251
Monsieur Poirot, just the man!

549
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:04,334
Would you be very kind
and help me push this out?

550
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:07,959
You require assistance, madame?

551
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:11,334
Oh! It's like trying
to launch the Mauritania.

552
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:14,626
Without the <i>champagne</i>!

553
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:17,959
<i>Voilà.</i>

554
00:43:18,084 --> 00:43:21,459
Oh, thank you so much. Oh...

555
00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:25,751
And, Monsieur Poirot,
please don't tell anyone where I've gone.

556
00:43:25,876 --> 00:43:28,793
- Everyone will keep following me about.
- Everyone, madame?

557
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:31,876
Well, perhaps some people
more than others, but...

558
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:33,709
I just want to be alone.

559
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:36,876
<i>- Voilà.</i>
- Enjoy your swim.

560
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,292
There she goes.

561
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,459
Not a care in the world!

562
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:31,293
- I'll make her care.
- Oh, what do you know about care?

563
00:44:31,376 --> 00:44:35,293
If it'd been up to you, the good Samaritan
would've passed by on the other side.

564
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:37,418
I have an idea, but I need to work it out.

565
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:40,251
Well, don't forget about my cousin,
Hatty Heimenheimer.

566
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:43,084
It took her so long to "work out an idea",

567
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:46,376
they finally had to stash her away
in the booby hatch!

568
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,417
Odell?

569
00:44:53,376 --> 00:44:54,709
Odell?

570
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,751
Hey, hey, hey, where's the fire?

571
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:12,209
Sorry.

572
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:15,334
- Have you had your breakfast?
- I had a piece of toast.

573
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:18,501
Linda, you really are naughty.

574
00:45:18,626 --> 00:45:22,126
Andreas goes to all the trouble
of preparing decent English breakfasts

575
00:45:22,251 --> 00:45:25,167
instead of those weedy continental things,

576
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:27,167
and you eat toast.

577
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,001
I'm sorry.
I just wasn't hungry.

578
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:31,834
What's the matter?

579
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:35,209
Is it Arlena?

580
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,667
She's so beastly.

581
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,534
You don't want to worry about her.

582
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:45,667
Things have a habit of working out.
I promise you.

583
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:47,209
Yes, if you make them.

584
00:45:47,334 --> 00:45:50,959
Would you like to come for a stroll
with me to the lighthouse? It'll be fun.

585
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:54,417
This must be my lucky day.
I've never been in such demand.

586
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:58,751
I'd like to, but I can't. I've already got
a date to go sketching with Christine.

587
00:45:58,876 --> 00:46:01,626
That's all right.
I'm glad to see you're making friends.

588
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:05,251
Good morning, Kenneth.

589
00:46:05,376 --> 00:46:06,876
Ah, good morning.

590
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:08,334
Good morning, darling.

591
00:46:08,459 --> 00:46:11,126
Oh, there's a letter for you.
The boatman just brought it over.

592
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:12,751
Ah, thank you.

593
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:15,001
Seeing your daughter
has just turned me down,

594
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:17,084
would you like to come for a walk with me,

595
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:19,126
before my staff meeting at 11:30?

596
00:46:19,251 --> 00:46:21,834
Oh, I'd love to,
but... but I'm afraid I can't.

597
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:24,251
This must be answered straight away.

598
00:46:24,376 --> 00:46:26,209
Well, this isn't my lucky day, Linda.

599
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:29,042
Well, you can't
get away from me at 12:30.

600
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:30,667
We're playing tennis.
Remember?

601
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:32,126
I remember.

602
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:35,168
Er... by the way, Linda,
have you seen your mother?

603
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,751
- No, thank God.
- Linda, I won't tell you again...

604
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:40,417
Oh, clean it, clean it.

605
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:42,334
Don't just lean on the thing.

606
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:48,667
Here we all are.

607
00:46:49,792 --> 00:46:51,251
Well...

608
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:54,126
Well, what a... colourful outfit!

609
00:46:54,251 --> 00:46:57,167
Oh! Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

610
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:59,876
Er, Linda and I
are going off sketching, Mr Marshall.

611
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:02,084
But don't worry,
I'll take good care of her.

612
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,876
- See you on the tennis courts at 12:30.
- Bye, Daddy.

613
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:06,626
Have a nice time.

614
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:11,834
Er, morning, Poirot.
Been swimming?

615
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:13,751
- You saw me?
- No.

616
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:15,709
Yes, I have been swimming! I, er...

617
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:19,709
There's nothing like the shock
of cold water and rhythmic movement

618
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:21,626
to stimulate the little grey cells.

619
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:25,551
Yes, of course. I, er... I don't suppose
you've seen my wife about, have you?

620
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:28,167
- Madame Marshall?
- Mmh.

621
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:30,417
What, she rose so early?

622
00:47:30,542 --> 00:47:33,209
Yeah, well, she's not in our rooms.

623
00:47:33,334 --> 00:47:36,417
Oh, by the way, I was looking
for that fellow Redfern earlier.

624
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:40,392
- I don't suppose you've seen him either?
- Is someone taking my name in vain?

625
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,001
A very good morning to you, gentlemen.

626
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,167
What kind of paintings
do you do, Mrs Redfern?

627
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:03,251
- Call me Christine.
- Thank you.

628
00:48:03,376 --> 00:48:06,376
Er, they're not paintings.
They're sketches...

629
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:24,792
I hate filthy birds.
I can't stand them.

630
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:27,917
I did some seagulls once.
It was very boring.

631
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:40,792
Hi, Patrick! Going for a spin?

632
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:44,334
How about taking me along?

633
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,584
Er... Well...

634
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:05,459
What time is it, dear?

635
00:51:09,251 --> 00:51:12,042
- Five to 12:00.
- Lord, I must fly!

636
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:14,542
I'm playing tennis at 12:30.

637
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:37,001
- That's a fine boat!
- I think it belongs to Sir Horace Blatt.

638
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:41,334
Odell and I were on it once, I think.

639
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:53,792
Look. I wonder who that is.

640
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:58,001
You know exactly who it is,
you naughty boy!

641
00:51:58,709 --> 00:52:01,001
Would you be a sport
and take the boat back for me?

642
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,959
I'll come back with Arlena, I'll walk.

643
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:05,751
Are you kidding?
I don't know how to work this thing.

644
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:09,709
Ah, look, it's simple. This lever puts her
in gear and all you have to do is steer.

645
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:12,876
Well, just this once.
But don't get me involved.

646
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:14,959
Oh, you're a sport.

647
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:32,417
Boo! Hey, come on! Wake up!

648
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:49,292
Oh, my God.

649
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:51,334
What's the matter?

650
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:53,751
She's dead!

651
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:56,251
She's been murdered!

652
00:52:57,376 --> 00:52:59,167
- Strangled!
- Strangled?

653
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:03,209
It's just not possible.

654
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:05,834
Well, we'd better get some help!

655
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:08,042
I'll go. You'll stay with the body.

656
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:10,501
Are you kidding? I can't do that!

657
00:53:10,626 --> 00:53:14,417
Yeah, you're right. The murderer
may still be about here somewhere.

658
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:17,793
- Can you make it to the hotel?
- In a flash. This thing's no problem.

659
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:19,209
Well, you'd better hurry!

660
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:39,626
Madame Marshall has been strangled.

661
00:53:40,459 --> 00:53:43,751
There are contusion marks
around the head and the neck.

662
00:53:43,876 --> 00:53:45,834
This much is evident.

663
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:49,417
We must now send for the police
and acquire a doctor

664
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:52,084
in order to establish the time of death.

665
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:55,417
Have you ever met a Tyranian doctor,
Monsieur Poirot?

666
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:59,584
The limit of their skill is determining
the fitness of an ox to pull a cart.

667
00:53:59,709 --> 00:54:02,501
That may be so, madame, but, er...

668
00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:06,584
Er, dear Monsieur Poirot,
a word in your ear.

669
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:09,626
The whole world knows that you are a man

670
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:12,001
of enormous discretion and gallantry,

671
00:54:12,126 --> 00:54:15,626
a man not only privy to the secrets
of kings and prime ministers,

672
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:19,293
but also a man who would never willingly
stand by and see a lady in trouble

673
00:54:19,376 --> 00:54:20,917
without rushing to her aid.

674
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:24,334
I appeal to you now, as just
such a frail woman in need of help.

675
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:27,209
- In fact, I throw myself on your mercy.
- Er...

676
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:30,001
Couldn't we make this
a private investigation?

677
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:33,334
You know how peculiar people can be
about a spot of murder.

678
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:36,709
The scandal of a famous stage star...

679
00:54:37,584 --> 00:54:39,917
being murdered here would ruin my hotel.

680
00:54:41,917 --> 00:54:43,126
I'm very sorry, madame,

681
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:48,042
but there is no way to avoid this
becoming an official matter.

682
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:52,751
Well, in due course of time,
of course I quite agree,

683
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:54,959
when it can be released
in the proper manner.

684
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:57,876
But consider,
just think what everyone will say

685
00:54:58,001 --> 00:55:01,792
if they were to discover
that you were here ahead of the police

686
00:55:01,917 --> 00:55:04,459
and failed to solve the crime.

687
00:55:06,626 --> 00:55:10,417
I mean, Monsieur Poirot,
both our reputations are at stake.

688
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:17,667
I bet it pongs something rotten in there.

689
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:20,876
Only of the breath of the sea.

690
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:23,626
Oh, how poetic you are, Monsieur Poirot.

691
00:55:24,376 --> 00:55:27,667
You have the true soul of France.

692
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:29,584
The true soul of Belgium, madame.

693
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:32,667
Oh, yes, of course.
Oh, how mortifyingly stupid of me!

694
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:34,334
Oh, do please forgive me.

695
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:37,334
In due course of time. Hmm.

696
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,334
What do you say, monsieur?

697
00:55:40,126 --> 00:55:44,584
Will you bring your colossal brain power
to the aid of a lady in distress?

698
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:48,109
Will you clear up this hideous mess
for me with all the brilliance...

699
00:55:48,626 --> 00:55:51,292
and discretion for which you are
world famous?

700
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:55,626
One moment, madame, I must carry out
a little investigation of my own

701
00:55:55,751 --> 00:55:57,501
before answering your question.

702
00:55:58,626 --> 00:56:03,334
Monsieur Redfern, at what time did you
and Madame Gardener find the body?

703
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:05,334
Oh, it was 12 o'clock exactly.

704
00:56:05,459 --> 00:56:08,626
That bloody gun went off as we were
coming round these rocks there.

705
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:11,126
As you know, I sent Mrs Gardener back
for help immediately.

706
00:56:11,209 --> 00:56:13,543
I touched nothing
except to make sure the body was dead.

707
00:56:13,626 --> 00:56:16,001
Oh, yes, you acted quite correctly.

708
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:19,876
Well, since I was the last person
to see Madame Marshall alive,

709
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:24,292
when I pushed her off
in her pedalo at about 10:20,

710
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:26,792
it means the time of death
can be established

711
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:30,542
as being between 10:30 and 12 noon.

712
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:33,292
How absolutely brilliant!

713
00:56:35,084 --> 00:56:37,884
A doctor after all could only give us
an approximate time

714
00:56:38,001 --> 00:56:40,251
and how she was killed, which I know.

715
00:56:40,376 --> 00:56:43,626
I don't need the help of a doctor!

716
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:45,876
Messieurs!

717
00:57:08,584 --> 00:57:10,834
It's a terrible tragedy, Poirot.

718
00:57:10,959 --> 00:57:12,376
It's terrible.

719
00:57:14,292 --> 00:57:17,167
She may have been a bit flighty,
Arlena, but...

720
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:19,209
no one would've wished this on her.

721
00:57:19,334 --> 00:57:21,001
Ah, just between ourselves,

722
00:57:21,126 --> 00:57:24,334
you may have guessed,
but she was the lady in question.

723
00:57:24,459 --> 00:57:26,709
That was not too difficult to guess.

724
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:29,959
I suppose it bloody wasn't.

725
00:57:30,084 --> 00:57:33,834
Well, I'd best chalk it all up
to experience and be on me way.

726
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:35,751
There's no point in intruding

727
00:57:35,876 --> 00:57:39,167
in the grief of the new husband
and all that sort of thing.

728
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:42,584
You had no chance
to speak to Madame Arlena?

729
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:46,168
Well, of course not.
I've only just arrived, haven't I?

730
00:57:46,251 --> 00:57:47,709
Oh, yes, of course.

731
00:57:47,834 --> 00:57:50,709
There's only one thing
that puzzles me in that case.

732
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:54,834
You remember the false diamond
I left in your possession?

733
00:57:54,959 --> 00:57:55,959
Yes.

734
00:57:56,084 --> 00:57:58,584
Well, then how did I happen
to find it once again

735
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:00,876
on the beach near the dead woman?

736
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:10,042
Oh, dammit, Poirot.
I'd make a rotten murderer, wouldn't I?

737
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:12,292
Leaving clues all over the place, eh?

738
00:58:13,876 --> 00:58:15,792
All right, I confess.

739
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:17,251
- You confess?
- No, I...

740
00:58:17,376 --> 00:58:20,251
I mean, I confess I had a word with her.

741
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:24,376
I was coming in on the boat and
I saw Arlena on one of them paddle things

742
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,542
going into a beach along there.

743
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:29,792
Anyway, I stopped the boat
and I rowed meself over.

744
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:33,959
I know. It's better than confronting her
in front of her husband, you know?

745
00:58:35,251 --> 00:58:39,751
We had a bit of a barney, what with her
pretending to be all surprised and that.

746
00:58:39,876 --> 00:58:42,542
Er, anyroad,
she promised to sort it out by tonight.

747
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:45,792
She did not tell you
where the real jewel was?

748
00:58:45,917 --> 00:58:47,417
No, dammit, she didn't.

749
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:50,459
If you don't mind, Monsieur Poirot,
I'd like to go and get changed now.

750
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:53,792
I'm getting a little chilly,
what with the shock and everything.

751
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:56,959
I was very fond of Arlena,
as you well know.

752
00:58:57,084 --> 00:58:59,334
Yes, you may well have been, monsieur.

753
00:58:59,459 --> 00:59:03,042
And yet there are cases of men
that have killed those women

754
00:59:03,167 --> 00:59:07,834
who made it impossible for them
to return to the wives they really loved.

755
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:10,376
Well, I assure you,
that is not the case here.

756
00:59:10,501 --> 00:59:12,709
I could have taken off
at any time I wanted.

757
00:59:12,834 --> 00:59:15,034
Anyway, you know
I had nothing to do with it.

758
00:59:15,126 --> 00:59:19,084
You yourself saw me from the terrace
go off in the boat with Mrs Gardener.

759
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:21,042
<i>Oui, c'est exact.</i>

760
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:24,542
It would seem
that I am your alibi, monsieur.

761
00:59:25,501 --> 00:59:27,667
Please go and get changed.

762
00:59:31,709 --> 00:59:35,376
So, that young man's been
sniffing round Arlena, has he?

763
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:37,709
Well, can't say I blame him.

764
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:40,876
I'm sorry, Sir Horace,
but it's my duty to put it to you

765
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:43,334
that you were furious with Madame Arlena,

766
00:59:43,459 --> 00:59:45,626
that you were determined
to get your jewel back,

767
00:59:45,709 --> 00:59:48,167
you came up here in order to demand it.

768
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:49,667
She laughed in your face.

769
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:52,959
You lost your temper, you strangled her.

770
00:59:53,084 --> 00:59:55,709
That is poppycock!
That is bloody poppycock!

771
00:59:55,834 --> 00:59:57,959
If it is poppycock,

772
00:59:58,084 --> 01:00:00,784
then it's most regrettable
that you said in front of me

773
01:00:00,876 --> 01:00:04,251
that you would willingly "wring her neck".

774
01:00:05,459 --> 01:00:08,959
Oh, well, that were...
That was just a bit of chat, that's all.

775
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:10,542
Oh!

776
01:00:10,667 --> 01:00:12,042
Look...

777
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:16,001
All I did was tell her that she couldn't
make a monkey out of me

778
01:00:16,126 --> 01:00:18,001
and I threw that bit of glass at her.

779
01:00:18,126 --> 01:00:21,667
Look, if I had killed her, my crew
would have seen me, wouldn't they?

780
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:23,668
They were all on deck, bloody watching.

781
01:00:23,751 --> 01:00:26,376
They're not averse to clocking
a decent bit of crumpet, are my lads.

782
01:00:26,459 --> 01:00:28,501
Sometimes I think it's the only thing
that wakes them up.

783
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:30,834
So, if you don't believe me, ask them!

784
01:00:32,584 --> 01:00:33,667
<i>Très bien.</i>

785
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:37,709
All the same, I must ask you
not to leave the island for the moment.

786
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:42,209
If you insist, but if I were you, Poirot,

787
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:45,584
I would <i>chercher le</i> hubby.

788
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:47,209
Huh.

789
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:50,984
You'll find they're favourite when
dealing with the Arlenas of this world.

790
01:00:52,542 --> 01:00:54,126
Hm.

791
01:00:58,626 --> 01:01:01,792
It's a little difficult
to accept your condolences, Poirot,

792
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:04,668
when in virtually the same breath
you accuse me of murdering my wife

793
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:06,043
because she was unfaithful to me.

794
01:01:06,126 --> 01:01:08,251
Oh, I can understand that, of course.

795
01:01:08,376 --> 01:01:10,918
But I hope you realise
I'm rather easier to get on with

796
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:13,917
than the Tyranian police would be.

797
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:16,334
And therefore I will ask you
where you were

798
01:01:16,459 --> 01:01:19,001
between 11:00 and 12:00 this morning.

799
01:01:19,126 --> 01:01:20,834
That's very simple.
I was in here typing

800
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:23,209
until I changed for tennis
a few minutes after 12:00.

801
01:01:23,292 --> 01:01:25,001
How very curious.

802
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:28,459
Because, you know,
when I passed by your door

803
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:33,084
at what must have been about 11:15,
I heard no sound.

804
01:01:33,209 --> 01:01:34,959
I can't help that.

805
01:01:35,084 --> 01:01:37,501
One does occasionally pause
to think, you know?

806
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:40,042
Here.

807
01:01:40,876 --> 01:01:42,459
This is what I typed.

808
01:01:42,584 --> 01:01:45,126
As you can see, it would have taken
at least an hour to do.

809
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:48,501
With respect, you could've typed that
yesterday, brought it in with you.

810
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:50,918
There's absolutely no proof
that you typed it this morning.

811
01:01:51,001 --> 01:01:53,042
Excuse me, Monsieur Poirot,

812
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,084
I just couldn't help overhearing.

813
01:01:55,209 --> 01:01:57,084
I have the proof you need.

814
01:01:57,209 --> 01:01:59,001
- You do, madame?
- Well, yes.

815
01:01:59,126 --> 01:02:02,376
You see, every week it's my custom
to collect all my staff together,

816
01:02:02,459 --> 01:02:04,126
give them a collective boot up the bum.

817
01:02:04,209 --> 01:02:07,251
It does them no end of good,
particularly the Eyeties.

818
01:02:07,376 --> 01:02:10,376
Keeps them up to snuff,
as my old papa used to say.

819
01:02:10,501 --> 01:02:12,876
Anyway, that meeting
was this morning at 11:30,

820
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:15,401
and just before it,
I came up here to have a wash

821
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:18,751
and I poked my nose in here
and I saw Kenneth hard at it, so I...

822
01:02:18,876 --> 01:02:20,376
I just didn't disturb him.

823
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:25,876
But, madame,
you cannot see the desk from the door.

824
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:32,292
I... I saw him in the mirror.

825
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,251
In the...

826
01:02:36,834 --> 01:02:38,667
Oh, in the mirror!

827
01:02:45,626 --> 01:02:47,834
My goodness, you do type fast, Ken.

828
01:02:47,959 --> 01:02:50,059
You must be the Horowitz of the Remington.

829
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:55,292
Tell me, madame,
how many fingers am I holding up?

830
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:00,459
Three.

831
01:03:02,459 --> 01:03:04,876
Yes. And now how many?

832
01:03:11,042 --> 01:03:13,709
Well, that...
That's not fair, you're hiding.

833
01:03:13,834 --> 01:03:17,001
Madame, you cannot see in the mirror
someone seated at the desk.

834
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:21,334
It is not me that is hiding,
it is you who are lying.

835
01:03:21,459 --> 01:03:23,292
Now, Monsieur Marshall,

836
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:27,292
are you, by any chance, lying also?

837
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:31,334
It should be fairly obvious, Poirot,
that that letter, all eight pages of it,

838
01:03:31,459 --> 01:03:33,959
is in reply to this one
from my stockbroker,

839
01:03:34,084 --> 01:03:37,459
which arrived by this morning's post
at about 10:30.

840
01:03:37,584 --> 01:03:39,667
It should, therefore, be equally obvious

841
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:42,501
that I must have typed it
when I said I did.

842
01:03:42,626 --> 01:03:44,751
Yes, it would appear so.

843
01:03:45,709 --> 01:03:47,917
Now to revert to you again, madame.

844
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:52,501
I'd like to ask you a question about your
promenade to the lighthouse this morning.

845
01:03:52,626 --> 01:03:56,292
- You went alone, I believe?
- Yes, I did.

846
01:03:56,417 --> 01:04:01,292
And you must have passed the bay
on which Arlena was murdered?

847
01:04:01,417 --> 01:04:02,917
Yes. Yes, I did.

848
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:05,834
I also saw Arlena sunning herself.

849
01:04:05,959 --> 01:04:07,209
Oh!

850
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:10,668
'But then you must have taken
the same path home.

851
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,084
'There is no logical alternative.

852
01:04:13,209 --> 01:04:15,042
'And I am suggesting to you,

853
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:17,376
'you could have gone down to the beach,

854
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:19,501
'murdered Arlena Marshall

855
01:04:19,626 --> 01:04:23,667
'and still been in time
for your staff meeting at 11:30.'

856
01:04:24,501 --> 01:04:26,001
What utter balderdash!

857
01:04:26,126 --> 01:04:28,334
You can't possibly think
I'd want to kill Arlena

858
01:04:28,417 --> 01:04:31,543
just because the silly cow
succeeded on the boards and I didn't.

859
01:04:31,626 --> 01:04:33,459
No, that I do not think.

860
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:37,042
But there is a certain tenderness
between you and Monsieur Marshall.

861
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:40,959
Otherwise why take that absurd risk
of trying to protect him just now?

862
01:04:41,084 --> 01:04:43,542
What if there is? What does it matter?

863
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:47,376
It matters because Madame Arlena
was in the way.

864
01:04:47,501 --> 01:04:49,834
Monsieur Poirot,
you have the French obsession...

865
01:04:49,917 --> 01:04:53,209
I'm sorry, the Belgian obsession,
with <i>crime passionnel.</i>

866
01:04:53,334 --> 01:04:55,184
But you're barking up the wrong tree.

867
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:57,834
You see, I know, I know who did it.

868
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:00,501
Huh! You do, madame?

869
01:05:00,626 --> 01:05:02,542
Of course.
It was Sir Horace Blatt.

870
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:06,209
When I came back here
from my walk at about 11:15,

871
01:05:06,334 --> 01:05:08,001
I saw him down on the beach.

872
01:05:08,126 --> 01:05:11,792
He was jumping up and down
and screaming blue murder at Arlena.

873
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:13,917
I've never seen a fellow in such a fury.

874
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:17,209
But why did you not
tell me this before, madame?

875
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:19,292
Well, he is an old chum, isn't he?

876
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:23,376
I didn't know then you were going to start
hurling accusations at me and Kenneth.

877
01:05:23,459 --> 01:05:26,876
But he is the chap you want, so why
don't you run along and question him?

878
01:05:26,959 --> 01:05:29,584
Yes. I already have done, madame.

879
01:05:30,209 --> 01:05:33,209
And he is exonerated by his crew.

880
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:35,959
All the same,
his story does confirm yours.

881
01:05:36,084 --> 01:05:39,126
Without knowing it, you have
corroborated your own alibi.

882
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:40,667
Bravo, madame.

883
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:45,876
I'm sorry, Kenneth.
I nearly put you in it.

884
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:47,626
I was only trying to help.

885
01:05:47,751 --> 01:05:49,292
I know.

886
01:05:50,001 --> 01:05:51,667
I forgive you.

887
01:05:55,334 --> 01:05:58,167
I don't want to hear
any more about it, Patrick.

888
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,834
If you hadn't been poodle-faking
with that awful woman,

889
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:03,168
you wouldn't have been there
in the first place!

890
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,834
Oh, madame.

891
01:06:05,876 --> 01:06:07,918
May I have a quick word with you, please,

892
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:09,917
about how you spent this morning?

893
01:06:10,959 --> 01:06:13,292
Why me?
I've got nothing to do with all this.

894
01:06:14,001 --> 01:06:17,334
You had no reason
to love Arlena Marshall, madame.

895
01:06:17,459 --> 01:06:19,126
Well, perhaps not.

896
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:23,376
But I was with Linda all morning.
I went to her room early

897
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:25,668
to ask her to come to Gull Cove
to do some sketching.

898
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:28,792
She wasn't there. I mean,
she came along a few moments later.

899
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:30,292
She'd been swimming.

900
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:33,667
And then we set off
and we were there all morning.

901
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:36,126
If you don't believe me, ask Linda.
She'll tell you.

902
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:39,584
<i>- Calmez-vous, madame.</i>
- Mr Poirot, I'm all right now.

903
01:06:39,709 --> 01:06:44,126
Now I want you to think about this
very, very carefully.

904
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:47,917
At what time precisely
did you leave the cove this morning?

905
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:51,459
Well, I was there until 12 o'clock
and I went off for my tennis game.

906
01:06:51,584 --> 01:06:53,001
You had a watch?

907
01:06:53,126 --> 01:06:54,542
No. No, I didn't.

908
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:57,417
Then how did you know
it was precisely 12 o'clock?

909
01:06:57,542 --> 01:07:00,459
Because, well,
when I climbed to the top of the cliff

910
01:07:00,584 --> 01:07:03,376
and was waving to Linda,
who'd gone for a swim,

911
01:07:03,501 --> 01:07:05,334
'that awful gun went off.

912
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:08,251
- 'The one they fire at noon every day.'
- 'Yes.

913
01:07:08,376 --> 01:07:11,292
'What did you do then, madame?'

914
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:14,817
'Well, I was late, you see, for my tennis,
which was fixed for 12:30,

915
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:17,876
'so I simply tore back to the hotel
as fast as I could

916
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:19,834
'and changed into my tennis things.

917
01:07:19,959 --> 01:07:22,126
'And I went to the court
where I met the others.

918
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:25,584
'Mr Marshall, Mrs Castle and Mr Gardener.

919
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,167
'I played with Mr Gardener.'

920
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:29,626
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh, not at all, my dear.

921
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:32,309
I was sketching at Gull Cove.
Lost track of the time.

922
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:35,501
Don't worry. It's only a matter
of four minutes exactly.

923
01:07:35,626 --> 01:07:37,459
I'm afraid you have to
come and play with me.

924
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:42,167
We'd barely started
when the news about Arlena came.

925
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:46,001
Of course, it's a dreadful thing,
Mr Poirot, but I can't pretend I'm not...

926
01:07:47,001 --> 01:07:49,251
A little relieved. Hmm.

927
01:07:49,376 --> 01:07:51,667
Well, I can understand that.

928
01:07:51,792 --> 01:07:54,292
Is there anything else you want to ask?

929
01:07:55,834 --> 01:07:57,792
Not for the time being. Hmm.

930
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,584
Come in.

931
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,792
- Hello.
- Hello.

932
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:15,876
Excuse me, mademoiselle,
for intruding into your grief.

933
01:08:16,001 --> 01:08:18,501
Grief? That's a good one.

934
01:08:18,626 --> 01:08:20,709
Why should I be sorry for Arlena?

935
01:08:21,542 --> 01:08:23,584
You hated her so much?

936
01:08:23,709 --> 01:08:26,126
I'm glad she's dead
if that's what you mean.

937
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:29,334
She was horrid to me
and beastly to my daddy.

938
01:08:29,459 --> 01:08:30,834
Yes.

939
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:34,584
Would you mind if I ask you
a few questions about this morning?

940
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:36,126
Why should I?

941
01:08:36,251 --> 01:08:38,334
I was with Christine Redfern.

942
01:08:38,459 --> 01:08:41,667
She wanted to go to Gull Cove
to draw some stupid cliffs.

943
01:08:42,459 --> 01:08:44,542
- And did she?
- Oh, yes.

944
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:47,292
She sat under her big hat
while I sunbathed.

945
01:08:47,417 --> 01:08:49,668
She gets all blistered
if she sits out in the sun.

946
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,667
- Yes.
- It's bad luck, really.

947
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:54,834
Here it is. She gave it to me.

948
01:08:54,959 --> 01:08:57,834
- It's not bad, really.
- No, she has talent, that one.

949
01:08:57,959 --> 01:08:59,917
These are undeniably, er...

950
01:09:01,292 --> 01:09:02,959
...cliffs.

951
01:09:03,084 --> 01:09:05,334
- When did she leave you?
- Five to 12:00.

952
01:09:05,459 --> 01:09:06,917
How can you be so sure?

953
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,792
Because she asked me.

954
01:09:09,876 --> 01:09:11,584
What time is it, dear?

955
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:17,834
- Five to 12:00.
- Lord, I must fly!

956
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:19,667
I'm playing tennis at 12:30.

957
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:22,709
'She got into a fearful panic
about being late for tennis

958
01:09:22,834 --> 01:09:24,584
'and rushed off back to the hotel.'

959
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:27,167
- Would you like this?
- Thanks. It's super.

960
01:09:28,584 --> 01:09:30,834
I'll see you later after my swim.

961
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:34,334
'I remember I was halfway down the
beach when Christine called after me.'

962
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:36,001
Don't forget your bathing cap!

963
01:09:36,126 --> 01:09:39,542
'I'd forgotten my bathing cap,
so I had to come back and put it on.

964
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:41,334
'What a bore!'

965
01:09:44,501 --> 01:09:47,417
Now did you see anyone else
while you were swimming?

966
01:09:47,542 --> 01:09:49,376
No. No one.

967
01:09:49,501 --> 01:09:52,551
Apart that is from Christine
waving from the top of the cliff.

968
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,542
Look!

969
01:09:58,667 --> 01:10:02,251
Why don't you stop asking me
all these silly questions about Christine?

970
01:10:02,376 --> 01:10:04,251
She couldn't have murdered Arlena.

971
01:10:04,376 --> 01:10:05,709
Neither could I.

972
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,751
That slimy Rex Brewster's
the one you should be talking to.

973
01:10:08,876 --> 01:10:10,292
He hated Arlena.

974
01:10:10,417 --> 01:10:12,542
He's the one who really wanted her dead.

975
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:13,959
How can you say that?

976
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:17,334
- He admired her so much.
- Don't be daft!

977
01:10:17,459 --> 01:10:21,459
He'd written this filthy book about her,
which she wouldn't allow him to publish.

978
01:10:21,542 --> 01:10:24,168
Excuse me, mademoiselle,
but how do you know all this?

979
01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:27,376
Cos I heard them having a row about it
on the beach yesterday.

980
01:10:27,501 --> 01:10:29,917
They thought I'd gone away, but I hadn't.

981
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:34,001
Maybe he won't be able to publish it
if he's hanged for murder first!

982
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:38,543
If I can't see you faces shining
in every knife, fork and spoon,

983
01:10:38,626 --> 01:10:40,543
I'll have your guts for garters,
understood?

984
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:44,126
Oh, madame! Have you any idea
where I can find Monsieur Brewster?

985
01:10:44,251 --> 01:10:47,626
Rex? I thought I saw him
go out into the garden.

986
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:49,292
Oh, but... Come here.

987
01:10:49,417 --> 01:10:50,876
He's not the one you want.

988
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:54,001
- You should <i>chercher la femme.</i>
- Really, madame?

989
01:10:54,126 --> 01:10:57,709
Absolutely. I have been having
a little think and I worked it all out.

990
01:10:57,834 --> 01:11:00,876
If Horace Blatt is in the clear
and Kenneth Marshall is in the clear

991
01:11:00,959 --> 01:11:04,167
and I'm in the clear
and Patrick Redfern is in the clear

992
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:07,292
and Myra Gardener is in the clear
because she was with him,

993
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:11,084
then it's all down
to little Miss Cringe, isn't it?

994
01:11:11,209 --> 01:11:13,584
- Miss Cringe?
- Yes.

995
01:11:13,709 --> 01:11:16,417
The jealous wife, Christine Redfern.

996
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:19,251
You don't wanna believe all that stuff
about her being too weedy.

997
01:11:19,334 --> 01:11:21,918
Women fight like tigers
when they're losing their husbands.

998
01:11:22,001 --> 01:11:24,293
Not that I've had much experience
in that sort of thing myself.

999
01:11:24,376 --> 01:11:28,376
But what is your theory?
I mean, how did Madame Christine do it?

1000
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:31,876
Well, I don't know. She probably battered
Arlena with a bit of driftwood

1001
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:35,334
and then finished her off with
a little pressure on the carotid artery?

1002
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:37,709
- The artery there, yes.
- The carotid artery.

1003
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:40,284
Everyone knows that.
It's in all the crime novels.

1004
01:11:40,376 --> 01:11:44,584
In fact, only the other day a child of 11
did something like that, in Hungary.

1005
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:46,126
Or was it Crete? I don't know,

1006
01:11:46,209 --> 01:11:48,626
but anyway,
she used a pair of nutcrackers.

1007
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:51,543
I know. Perhaps I'd better
go and see if any are missing.

1008
01:11:51,626 --> 01:11:56,626
No, madame, unfortunately, there are
no nutcracker marks on the throat.

1009
01:11:57,667 --> 01:12:00,292
And Madame Christine
could not possibly have done it.

1010
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:03,584
Her alibi had been confirmed
by Mademoiselle Linda

1011
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:06,751
and vice versa.

1012
01:12:08,042 --> 01:12:10,042
How very irritating!

1013
01:12:10,667 --> 01:12:14,417
"Under the high...

1014
01:12:15,917 --> 01:12:17,917
"lazy...

1015
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:23,084
"noonday Adriatic sun,

1016
01:12:23,209 --> 01:12:25,584
"the body lay on its back,

1017
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:27,751
"arms outstretched,

1018
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:33,376
"parodying in death a position
she so often occupied in life."

1019
01:12:33,501 --> 01:12:36,376
Oh. That is marvellous. That's...

1020
01:12:38,251 --> 01:12:39,834
Oh.

1021
01:12:39,959 --> 01:12:43,259
So, you've come, Monsieur Poirot,
to question me about poor Arlena.

1022
01:12:43,376 --> 01:12:47,542
I am shattered.
I am absolutely shattered.

1023
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:52,209
She was so wonderfully funny,
so very generous.

1024
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:54,334
Not generous enough to give you a release,

1025
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:57,209
so you could publish that manuscript, eh?

1026
01:12:57,334 --> 01:12:58,584
Who told you that?

1027
01:12:58,709 --> 01:13:00,834
Never mind, but it is the truth,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1028
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:02,459
You cannot libel the dead.

1029
01:13:02,584 --> 01:13:08,209
Now you are free to publish
your saucy tales and reap the reward.

1030
01:13:08,334 --> 01:13:12,376
Well, I will admit, from that
point of view, I have benefitted.

1031
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:17,167
Oh, but I assure you, monsieur,
that the loss of so radiant a performer

1032
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:20,667
infinitely exceeds
any possible gain to myself.

1033
01:13:21,626 --> 01:13:23,292
You must believe that.

1034
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:27,792
The time of death has been narrowed
to between 11:30 and 12:00.

1035
01:13:27,917 --> 01:13:29,542
Where were you at this time?

1036
01:13:32,626 --> 01:13:35,167
- I was on a pedalo.
- A pedalo?

1037
01:13:35,292 --> 01:13:36,626
Mm.

1038
01:13:36,751 --> 01:13:38,251
Whereabouts?

1039
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:41,251
How should I know?

1040
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:43,276
I wasn't carrying a chart at the time.

1041
01:13:43,376 --> 01:13:45,834
<i>Oh, que c'est amusant.</i>
How amusing that is!

1042
01:13:46,917 --> 01:13:49,467
Chart or no chart,
it was perfectly possible for you

1043
01:13:49,584 --> 01:13:52,417
to have watched
Sir Horace Blatt's boat leave

1044
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:55,584
and then to have pedaloed into Ladder Bay,

1045
01:13:55,709 --> 01:13:59,542
there to find
the unsuspecting Arlena asleep,

1046
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:02,751
and then you strangled her.

1047
01:14:02,876 --> 01:14:06,376
'Monsieur Poirot, are you aware
that it would take nearly two hours

1048
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:09,417
'to paddle around the island
from Ladder Bay to Gull Bay?

1049
01:14:09,542 --> 01:14:13,376
'At 12 o'clock precisely,
as that boring old gun went off,

1050
01:14:13,501 --> 01:14:15,376
'I pedalled into Gull Bay.

1051
01:14:15,501 --> 01:14:17,709
'Linda was there, swimming.

1052
01:14:17,834 --> 01:14:21,584
'In fact I nearly hit her. She was
splashing around like a deaf seal.'

1053
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:24,334
'You say that you saw Mademoiselle Linda

1054
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:26,876
'swimming in Gull Bay at 12 o'clock?'

1055
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:29,917
'Certainly,
I asked her to help me pedal back,

1056
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:32,126
'but the little charmer refused.'

1057
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:34,209
What do you want?

1058
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:38,584
What did you say?

1059
01:14:38,709 --> 01:14:42,251
I said, "Good god, darling.
Help me pedal this damned thing back.

1060
01:14:42,376 --> 01:14:43,959
"My legs are killing me."

1061
01:14:44,084 --> 01:14:45,667
Pedal it back yourself!

1062
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:53,626
So you see, darling,
I simply could not have killed Arlena.

1063
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:59,126
Monsieur, if you are so anxious
to find a murderer,

1064
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:01,542
why don't you find out
who tried to murder me?

1065
01:15:03,084 --> 01:15:04,417
Murder you?

1066
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:06,876
What do you mean?

1067
01:15:07,751 --> 01:15:11,834
Well, after I'd been left by that
lazy little cow Linda to rupture myself,

1068
01:15:11,959 --> 01:15:13,209
I pedalled off.

1069
01:15:14,126 --> 01:15:17,168
'About ten minutes later,
a bottle came whizzing over the cliff

1070
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:20,042
'and smacked down in the water
right next to me.

1071
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:22,267
'The damned thing
missed my head by inches.

1072
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:24,417
'I looked up. There's nobody around.'

1073
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:32,751
Well, I must congratulate you on that
highly interesting and imaginative story.

1074
01:15:32,876 --> 01:15:37,792
I refer of course to your visit,
your fictional visit, to Gull Bay at noon.

1075
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:41,501
Er, what do you mean,
"fictional"? Linda!

1076
01:15:41,626 --> 01:15:44,709
Mademoiselle Linda denies
having seen anyone there at the time.

1077
01:15:44,792 --> 01:15:48,542
What? Oh, that lousy little hoyden!

1078
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:51,709
I mean, I know she loathes me
because I adored Arlena,

1079
01:15:51,834 --> 01:15:54,534
but this is ridiculous.
You just wait till I catch her.

1080
01:15:55,001 --> 01:15:56,292
You! Linda!

1081
01:15:56,834 --> 01:16:00,084
Hey! Linda. You, you, you just wait!

1082
01:16:00,209 --> 01:16:02,292
Stay, stay right... Linda!

1083
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:05,959
Ah, Linda, you tell Monsieur Poirot
that I was with you this morning

1084
01:16:06,084 --> 01:16:07,834
when you were swimming in Gull Cove.

1085
01:16:07,917 --> 01:16:09,542
Why should I? You weren't.

1086
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:12,417
What? You lying little brat!

1087
01:16:13,126 --> 01:16:15,917
You just tell him
that you saw me on that pedalo.

1088
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:19,292
You tell him that you refused
to help me pedal back! You tell him!

1089
01:16:20,084 --> 01:16:21,709
Oh! You tell him!

1090
01:16:21,834 --> 01:16:25,634
- Take your hands off my daughter!
- Then you tell her to tell him the truth!

1091
01:16:26,626 --> 01:16:28,667
Well, Linda, did you see Mr Brewster

1092
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:31,167
when you were bathing
in Gull Cove this morning?

1093
01:16:35,626 --> 01:16:37,459
Oh, all right then. Yes, I did.

1094
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:40,834
Linda, you mustn't tell lies.

1095
01:16:40,959 --> 01:16:44,084
- You can get people into serious trouble.
- Serious trouble?

1096
01:16:44,209 --> 01:16:46,251
Hell, darling!
You can get them hanged!

1097
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:49,167
That was rather the idea,
was it not, mademoiselle?

1098
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:52,459
I'm sorry.

1099
01:16:57,792 --> 01:17:00,209
Kindly accept my apologies, monsieur.

1100
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:03,126
Incidentally, I accept your alibi.

1101
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:06,667
That's real white of you, Mr P!

1102
01:17:15,876 --> 01:17:18,959
Now, Monsieur Poirot.
I'm not as lucky as my dear wife.

1103
01:17:19,084 --> 01:17:21,709
I have absolutely no alibi.

1104
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:26,084
I was sitting over there
on a stone bench reading my book,

1105
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:30,542
and between the hours
of 11:00 and 12:15, I didn't move.

1106
01:17:30,667 --> 01:17:32,751
Now, I'm well aware, Monsieur Poirot,

1107
01:17:32,876 --> 01:17:35,792
that in your world,
when a murder takes place,

1108
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:39,626
everyone automatically
comes up with a watertight alibi.

1109
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:42,709
However, I belong to that great world

1110
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:46,292
of millions of innocent men and women

1111
01:17:46,417 --> 01:17:49,834
who, curiously enough,
don't have the foresight

1112
01:17:49,959 --> 01:17:52,251
to provide themselves with an alibi

1113
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:56,209
when a murder is taking place
of which they know absolutely nothing.

1114
01:17:57,042 --> 01:18:02,084
Consequently,
as I was guilelessly reading my book,

1115
01:18:02,209 --> 01:18:07,001
there was no gardener to come trotting by
respectfully touching his forelock

1116
01:18:07,126 --> 01:18:10,792
and registering the time
on his grandfather's turnip watch.

1117
01:18:10,917 --> 01:18:14,917
In short, Monsieur Poirot,
I don't have the ghost of an alibi.

1118
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:21,376
Of course, I could have scampered over
the top of that peak, like a mountain goat

1119
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:27,001
and, er... swarmed down
the famous steps we've all heard about

1120
01:18:27,126 --> 01:18:28,834
and then crept up on Arlena

1121
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:33,001
and strangled her
with these powerful hands of mine.

1122
01:18:33,126 --> 01:18:35,834
But, unfortunately for you,
I did no such thing.

1123
01:18:35,959 --> 01:18:39,792
So, you see,
I have a big fat motive, but no alibi.

1124
01:18:44,251 --> 01:18:45,584
Next question?

1125
01:18:46,626 --> 01:18:48,834
Next question is what did you do

1126
01:18:48,959 --> 01:18:52,667
when you had finished
being unobserved in the garden?

1127
01:18:53,376 --> 01:18:58,251
I went up to my room,
again unobserved, to change for tennis.

1128
01:18:58,376 --> 01:19:00,584
I was rather thirsty
and so I rang the bell.

1129
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:02,167
'Naturally, no one answered.

1130
01:19:02,292 --> 01:19:05,251
'Where the goddamn staff
had disappeared to was a mystery

1131
01:19:05,376 --> 01:19:07,959
'worthy even of your talents,
Monsieur Poirot.

1132
01:19:08,876 --> 01:19:11,676
'I turned on the tap,
but there was no water. Not a drop.

1133
01:19:11,792 --> 01:19:15,626
'Someone was running a bath
down the hall fit to float Noah's Ark.

1134
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:19,042
"'Damned odd time for a bath",
I'd have said.

1135
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:24,917
'Anyway, I changed and appeared
suitably attired in my Fred Perry outfit

1136
01:19:25,042 --> 01:19:28,667
'on the tennis court at precisely 12:30

1137
01:19:28,792 --> 01:19:30,834
'to join Daphne and Marshall.

1138
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:33,917
'Mrs Redfern came a few minutes later.'

1139
01:19:35,709 --> 01:19:38,126
And that, Monsieur Poirot,

1140
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:40,126
concludes the case for the defence.

1141
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,501
Hm, you make pleasantries, monsieur,

1142
01:19:43,626 --> 01:19:46,417
but no alibi is still...

1143
01:19:49,042 --> 01:19:50,501
...no alibi.

1144
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:53,626
Hm.

1145
01:20:01,334 --> 01:20:03,684
If you're looking for that,
I've got it in here.

1146
01:20:04,459 --> 01:20:07,501
I've been using it
to sort everything out for you.

1147
01:20:07,626 --> 01:20:09,418
Look, I was wrong about <i>chercher la femme.</i>

1148
01:20:09,501 --> 01:20:12,459
Sorry about that, but it's quite obviously
<i>chercher le fruit.</i>

1149
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:15,501
Rexy is the only one unaccounted for.
Look, look, I'll show you.

1150
01:20:15,584 --> 01:20:19,292
See, at 11:30, Arlena Marshall
was left here alive by Horace Blatt,

1151
01:20:19,417 --> 01:20:21,084
who then sailed on down here.

1152
01:20:21,209 --> 01:20:24,042
Now, at the same time,
Myra and Patrick were here,

1153
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:26,667
Linda and Christine were here,
Kenneth was here

1154
01:20:26,792 --> 01:20:28,292
and I was in my staff meeting.

1155
01:20:28,417 --> 01:20:32,417
So it has just got to be
our genial columnist.

1156
01:20:32,542 --> 01:20:34,542
And, what's more, I know how he did it.

1157
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:36,417
- Oh, you do, madame?
- Absolutely!

1158
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:39,959
See, recently I was reading a
magazine story about a woman in Malaya

1159
01:20:40,084 --> 01:20:44,459
who was drowned by a huge moray eel,
which darted out of a hole,

1160
01:20:44,584 --> 01:20:48,876
dragged her to the floor of the ocean,
its teeth buried in her throat.

1161
01:20:49,001 --> 01:20:52,001
Now that's what gave me
the clue I needed. You see, Rex...

1162
01:20:52,126 --> 01:20:55,834
Rex Brewster could've been lurking
in the water here off Ladder Bay

1163
01:20:55,959 --> 01:20:58,167
and when Arlena appeared on her pedalo,

1164
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:00,626
he could have leapt up,
pulled her off it...

1165
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:02,417
Er, very interesting, madame.

1166
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:06,584
The only snag is of course
that Madame Marshall was not drowned.

1167
01:21:06,709 --> 01:21:09,876
Far less was she gnawed to death.

1168
01:21:10,001 --> 01:21:12,376
And perhaps
even more damaging to your theory

1169
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:15,126
is the fact that it has been established

1170
01:21:15,251 --> 01:21:17,876
that Monsieur Brewster
was here in Gull Cove

1171
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:20,542
with Mademoiselle Linda at 12 o'clock.

1172
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:25,209
He could not possibly have pedalled
all the way from Gull Cove to Ladder Bay

1173
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:27,584
in half an hour.

1174
01:21:27,709 --> 01:21:29,751
Well, that's very inconvenient of him.

1175
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:32,959
I mean, if he didn't do it, who did?

1176
01:21:33,084 --> 01:21:36,042
I just don't see who could have.
Everyone has an alibi.

1177
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:37,792
Oh, no, they do not, madame.

1178
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:39,793
Monsieur Gardener does not have an alibi.

1179
01:21:39,876 --> 01:21:41,459
Seems rather proud of the fact.

1180
01:21:41,584 --> 01:21:44,792
Oh, but he does, dear, most definitely.

1181
01:21:45,459 --> 01:21:47,059
What are you telling me, madame?

1182
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:49,917
At half-past 11
I was having my staff meeting,

1183
01:21:50,042 --> 01:21:54,459
you know, giving the hired help
a pleasing stream of the old rancid,

1184
01:21:54,584 --> 01:21:56,626
and in particular pointing out to Andreas

1185
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:59,918
that there was absolutely no point
in making your <i>curry de poulet vindaloo</i>

1186
01:22:00,001 --> 01:22:03,459
so hot that it actually raised welts
on the surface of your tongue,

1187
01:22:03,584 --> 01:22:07,167
when I looked out of the window
and there was Odell reading a book.

1188
01:22:08,001 --> 01:22:11,251
He stayed there throughout
the entire meeting. I'm positive of it.

1189
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:14,751
Well, what's the matter?
Have I said something?

1190
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:16,526
You've said a great deal, madame.

1191
01:22:17,459 --> 01:22:19,167
Oh, I...

1192
01:22:19,292 --> 01:22:20,917
I see what you mean.

1193
01:22:21,876 --> 01:22:24,167
You... You mean nobody did it.

1194
01:22:25,834 --> 01:22:28,959
And yet we still have a body, madame.

1195
01:24:19,959 --> 01:24:22,834
- Ah, "Rigoletto".
- Correct.

1196
01:24:22,959 --> 01:24:25,042
Ah, Verdi. <i>Quelle élégance!</i>

1197
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:29,084
It's funny to think, if Giuseppe Verdi
had been an Englishman,

1198
01:24:29,209 --> 01:24:32,084
his name would have been Joe Green.

1199
01:24:32,876 --> 01:24:34,959
Yes, I suppose it would, yes.

1200
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:37,459
Well, it used to make the boys laugh

1201
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:40,251
when I was trying to din Latin
into them when I was a teacher.

1202
01:24:40,334 --> 01:24:43,418
Little boys laugh easily
if it keeps them away, even for a moment,

1203
01:24:43,501 --> 01:24:45,126
from their study of Latin.

1204
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:53,167
Messieurs-Dames, please forgive me
for interrupting the cocktail hour,

1205
01:24:53,292 --> 01:24:56,668
but there are two questions of great
importance, which I must put to you.

1206
01:24:56,751 --> 01:25:01,834
First of all, did anybody here
throw a bottle into the sea this morning?

1207
01:25:04,084 --> 01:25:05,084
No?

1208
01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:09,459
Secondly, did any of you
take a bath at 12:15 today?

1209
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:12,084
An odd time for ablutions.

1210
01:25:13,376 --> 01:25:15,417
Hmm. How remarkable!

1211
01:25:16,084 --> 01:25:19,542
A bath which nobody admits having taken

1212
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:22,167
and a bottle which flies by itself.

1213
01:25:24,334 --> 01:25:26,501
Joe Green.

1214
01:25:26,626 --> 01:25:29,792
It's rather more amusing
than at first I thought.

1215
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:08,209
- Morning, Sir Horace!
- Hello, lass. Enjoy your swim?

1216
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:11,876
Yes. Sorry I'm so puffed. The water was
freezing and I'm running to get warm.

1217
01:27:11,959 --> 01:27:14,042
Crying his eyes out?

1218
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:16,917
- Tell him to pull himself together.
- Hello, Daph!

1219
01:27:17,042 --> 01:27:19,376
That reminds me of a lady policeman.

1220
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:21,167
Look, she's all out of breath.

1221
01:27:21,292 --> 01:27:23,792
She's telling her friends
how she caught a burglar.

1222
01:27:23,917 --> 01:27:27,917
She said, "I chased him past the grocer's,
and the butcher's and the baker's."

1223
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:31,667
And then she said,
"I finally caught him by the cobbler's."

1224
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:36,376
Sorry, I don't find that remotely funny,
Sir Horace.

1225
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:39,751
Oh, oh... I stand corrected, Daph.

1226
01:27:39,876 --> 01:27:43,876
I'll tell you what I don't find so funny,
and that's waiting for the great detective!

1227
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:47,876
- Oh, good morning, Monsieur Poirot!
- Listen here, Poirot.

1228
01:27:48,001 --> 01:27:50,376
Not only have you not
found Arlena's killer,

1229
01:27:50,501 --> 01:27:52,376
but what is more,
you haven't found my diamond,

1230
01:27:52,459 --> 01:27:54,209
so I'm off if it's all the same to you.

1231
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:57,376
The Gardeners and the Redferns
want to go, too.

1232
01:27:57,501 --> 01:28:00,834
I can't say I blame them.
The place is like a morgue.

1233
01:28:00,959 --> 01:28:02,501
Oh, I am so sorry.

1234
01:28:03,126 --> 01:28:05,834
Madame, there is nothing like
a good night's rest

1235
01:28:05,959 --> 01:28:09,376
to clear the little grey cells.

1236
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:12,251
Kindly ask all our friends
to forgather in the lounge

1237
01:28:12,376 --> 01:28:14,792
after they have finished
their <i>petit déjeuner.</i>

1238
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:18,584
- When all will be revealed.
- What?

1239
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:20,709
- You mean you know?
- Oh, yes.

1240
01:28:21,626 --> 01:28:23,292
Well, give us a few clues!

1241
01:28:23,917 --> 01:28:26,126
I wish you to consider very carefully,

1242
01:28:26,251 --> 01:28:30,084
a bathing cap, a bath, a bottle,
a wristwatch, the diamond,

1243
01:28:30,209 --> 01:28:34,042
the noonday gun, the breath of the sea
and the height of the cliff.

1244
01:28:35,084 --> 01:28:37,834
From that you should be able
to solve it yourselves.

1245
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:40,876
We meet again in one hour.

1246
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:44,917
Now I am going to have
my <i>œuf à la coque</i>. Ah...

1247
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:50,959
There goes the most insufferable man
in the world!

1248
01:28:51,084 --> 01:28:54,542
<i>"Œuf à la coque."</i>That's about his mark.
It's what he talks mostly.

1249
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:20,251
<i>Mesdames, mademoiselle, messieurs.</i>

1250
01:29:21,167 --> 01:29:24,717
The reason I asked you to meet me here
this morning, please, monsieur...

1251
01:29:26,167 --> 01:29:28,959
...is that I, Hercule Poirot,

1252
01:29:29,084 --> 01:29:32,667
have discovered the identity
of the murderer of Madame Marshall.

1253
01:29:32,792 --> 01:29:35,084
This need surprise no one.

1254
01:29:36,834 --> 01:29:39,001
Are you all comfortable?

1255
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,251
Even the murderer?

1256
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:48,626
This has been a most unusual crime,

1257
01:29:48,751 --> 01:29:52,709
in that apparently nobody
had the opportunity of committing it.

1258
01:29:52,834 --> 01:29:56,834
Madame Marshall was killed
between 11:30 and 12 noon yesterday

1259
01:29:56,959 --> 01:29:59,542
and yet every single one of you
had a perfect alibi,

1260
01:29:59,667 --> 01:30:03,167
including you, Monsieur Gardener,
without knowing it.

1261
01:30:03,292 --> 01:30:06,042
I'm very sorry if I have disappointed you.

1262
01:30:06,917 --> 01:30:09,667
We had undeniably a body,

1263
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:12,001
which meant that somebody was lying.

1264
01:30:13,167 --> 01:30:14,501
Who?

1265
01:30:15,459 --> 01:30:18,084
After exercising considerable reflection,

1266
01:30:18,792 --> 01:30:21,959
I came to the conclusion
that it was you...

1267
01:30:26,126 --> 01:30:27,459
...Madame Redfern.

1268
01:30:29,834 --> 01:30:31,376
Me?

1269
01:30:32,251 --> 01:30:34,376
But I didn't lie to you. I swear it.

1270
01:30:34,501 --> 01:30:35,917
Oh, yes, you did, madame.

1271
01:30:36,042 --> 01:30:38,751
When I asked you at what time
you left Gull Cove yesterday,

1272
01:30:38,834 --> 01:30:40,876
you said it was 12 o'clock.

1273
01:30:41,001 --> 01:30:46,542
You knew this, you said,
because you heard that awful gun go off

1274
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:49,209
'when you were standing
on top of the cliffs waving at Linda

1275
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:51,192
'who was swimming in the water below.'

1276
01:30:54,709 --> 01:30:57,959
But Monsieur Brewster
was in the bay at the same time.

1277
01:30:58,084 --> 01:31:01,001
It is very curious
that you did not mention him.

1278
01:31:01,126 --> 01:31:04,376
And it's even more curious
that when I confronted Monsieur Brewster

1279
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:07,626
with the fact that his story
about entering the bay on his pedalo

1280
01:31:07,709 --> 01:31:10,042
at the very moment
that the midday gun went off

1281
01:31:10,167 --> 01:31:12,751
was denied by Linda, he lost his temper.

1282
01:31:12,876 --> 01:31:14,209
He attacked the poor girl.

1283
01:31:14,334 --> 01:31:17,876
It would've been so much easier for him
to have called his second witness.

1284
01:31:17,959 --> 01:31:21,667
You, madame. He must have seen you
standing on top of the cliff.

1285
01:31:21,792 --> 01:31:23,442
And yet he made no mention of it.

1286
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:25,917
Why not? The answer is obvious.

1287
01:31:26,542 --> 01:31:28,126
'You were not there.'

1288
01:31:31,084 --> 01:31:34,917
But I was there!
And I did wave and Linda waved back.

1289
01:31:35,042 --> 01:31:37,742
- Tell him, Linda!
- It's true. She did wave, honestly.

1290
01:31:38,209 --> 01:31:41,792
Yes, she probably waved, but there was
no noonday gun, was there?

1291
01:31:41,917 --> 01:31:43,459
I don't remember it. No.

1292
01:31:43,584 --> 01:31:45,876
There was no noonday gun
for a very good reason.

1293
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:47,501
It was not 12 o'clock.

1294
01:31:47,626 --> 01:31:50,751
But she asked me the time. I looked
at my watch and it was five to 12!

1295
01:31:50,834 --> 01:31:53,584
Ah, the watch.
Now that is very important.

1296
01:31:53,709 --> 01:31:55,918
Let us go back
to yesterday morning, shall we?

1297
01:31:56,001 --> 01:31:59,667
'I was having breakfast
on the terrace, an egg,

1298
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:03,418
'and in the course of performing some act
of <i>léger de main</i> for you, mademoiselle,

1299
01:32:03,501 --> 01:32:06,501
'I happened to notice
that you were not wearing a watch.

1300
01:32:06,626 --> 01:32:09,709
'This was not particularly surprising
as you had been swimming.

1301
01:32:09,792 --> 01:32:13,876
'A fact that could be noted by anyone
looking out of a hotel window.

1302
01:32:14,001 --> 01:32:18,584
'You, Madame Redfern, actually told me
you went to her room early

1303
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:23,084
'to ask her to come with you to Gull Cove
to do some sketching.

1304
01:32:23,209 --> 01:32:25,876
'But that she was not there.

1305
01:32:26,001 --> 01:32:30,459
'What a perfect opportunity to put
Mademoiselle Linda's watch forward...

1306
01:32:30,584 --> 01:32:32,001
'20 minutes?

1307
01:32:33,126 --> 01:32:34,976
'A few moments later, as you told me,

1308
01:32:35,667 --> 01:32:40,417
'Linda appeared in the corridor,
as you knew she would.

1309
01:32:40,542 --> 01:32:42,876
'And you invited her to accompany you.'

1310
01:32:43,001 --> 01:32:45,201
- Would you like to come?
- Yes, I'd love to.

1311
01:32:45,292 --> 01:32:47,542
All right.
See you in the hall in ten minutes.

1312
01:32:48,834 --> 01:32:50,292
Hello, Mr Poirot.

1313
01:32:53,792 --> 01:32:58,042
Your plan to make Linda your false alibi
was now in motion.

1314
01:32:58,167 --> 01:33:02,251
Hmm. This is pure supposition, Poirot.
I've never heard such twaddle.

1315
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:06,292
Twaddle or not, it is the only explanation
which fits all the facts.

1316
01:33:06,417 --> 01:33:08,126
Now if you will be a little patient,

1317
01:33:08,209 --> 01:33:12,542
I will explain to you exactly
what happened next at Gull Cove.

1318
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:16,209
'Madame Redfern, unseen by Linda,
consulted her own watch,

1319
01:33:16,334 --> 01:33:19,001
'which she was wearing but kept concealed

1320
01:33:19,126 --> 01:33:22,126
'under the sleeve
of that strange voluminous outfit

1321
01:33:22,251 --> 01:33:24,667
'she chose to protect her from the sun.

1322
01:33:24,792 --> 01:33:28,376
'It is of course 25 to 12:00.

1323
01:33:28,501 --> 01:33:33,334
'She then asked Linda the time,
who naturally said it was five to 12:00.

1324
01:33:33,959 --> 01:33:37,167
'Linda then starts to go down to the sea.

1325
01:33:37,292 --> 01:33:38,709
'While her back is turned,

1326
01:33:38,834 --> 01:33:42,167
'Madame Redfern returns Linda's watch
to the correct time,

1327
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:48,292
'then calls Linda back, telling her
she has forgotten her bathing cap.

1328
01:33:48,417 --> 01:33:52,626
'Now why should she bother to do that,
you may ask?

1329
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:54,626
'The answer is simple.

1330
01:33:54,751 --> 01:33:58,542
'Remember, at 12 o'clock
the noonday gun is due to go off.

1331
01:33:58,667 --> 01:34:03,501
'And she can take no chance of Linda
hearing and noting it.

1332
01:34:03,626 --> 01:34:08,501
'A girl splashing about in the sea
and wearing a bathing cap

1333
01:34:08,626 --> 01:34:11,126
'would hear nothing.

1334
01:34:12,584 --> 01:34:14,334
'So let us see exactly what happened

1335
01:34:14,417 --> 01:34:18,334
'as Madame Redfern hurried up
from the cove to the top of the cliff.

1336
01:34:18,459 --> 01:34:23,334
'It is 20 to 12:00. She pauses to wave.

1337
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:25,334
'Linda waves back.

1338
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:27,834
'But there is no Mr Brewster.

1339
01:34:27,959 --> 01:34:30,001
'No noonday gun.

1340
01:34:30,126 --> 01:34:34,667
'Madame Redfern now turns
and runs across the path

1341
01:34:34,792 --> 01:34:37,126
'which separates Gull Cove
from Ladder Bay.

1342
01:34:37,251 --> 01:34:41,167
'That takes her six or seven minutes,
no more.

1343
01:34:41,292 --> 01:34:43,942
'She arrives at Ladder Bay
at about a quarter to 12:00

1344
01:34:44,042 --> 01:34:46,376
'and sees Madame Arlena
sitting impatiently,

1345
01:34:46,501 --> 01:34:48,709
'awaiting the arrival of Patrick Redfern,

1346
01:34:48,834 --> 01:34:51,667
'with whom, I am convinced,
she had a rendezvous.'

1347
01:34:53,334 --> 01:34:54,709
Oh, Christ!

1348
01:34:54,834 --> 01:34:58,751
'Suddenly, to her great chagrin
she sees you, madame,

1349
01:34:58,876 --> 01:35:01,042
'about to come down the ladder.'

1350
01:35:01,167 --> 01:35:05,501
I couldn't have climbed down the ladder.
I suffer from vertigo. You know that.

1351
01:35:05,626 --> 01:35:09,334
I only know that because you took
good care to stage an incident

1352
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:11,917
showing me that you suffer from vertigo.

1353
01:35:12,042 --> 01:35:14,542
The day before yesterday, on the terrace.

1354
01:35:15,917 --> 01:35:19,126
'As we were having a stroll
and I was drawing your attention

1355
01:35:19,251 --> 01:35:21,168
'to the sunbathing figures
on the beach below us,

1356
01:35:21,251 --> 01:35:23,459
'you suddenly fell against me
and stepped back,

1357
01:35:23,542 --> 01:35:26,001
'saying you suffered from vertigo.'

1358
01:35:26,126 --> 01:35:28,834
But she does have it, Poirot.
She's always had it.

1359
01:35:28,959 --> 01:35:30,542
That is not the case, monsieur.

1360
01:35:30,667 --> 01:35:33,292
Your wife only pretended to have it
in order to prove

1361
01:35:33,417 --> 01:35:35,876
that she could not
have climbed down the ladder.

1362
01:35:36,959 --> 01:35:42,292
'But, yesterday afternoon, I myself
stood on the cliff overlooking Gull Cove

1363
01:35:42,417 --> 01:35:46,417
'and I discovered something
rather interesting.

1364
01:35:47,209 --> 01:35:50,709
'In order to have seen Linda
in the water below

1365

'and to wave to her,

1366
01:35:52,584 --> 01:35:56,917
'you would have had
to stand right on the very edge.

1367
01:35:57,667 --> 01:36:00,667
'Although I do not suffer from vertigo,

1368
01:36:00,792 --> 01:36:04,167
'I myself... was quite dizzy.'

1369
01:36:06,126 --> 01:36:08,626
For you, madame,
had you suffered from vertigo,

1370
01:36:08,751 --> 01:36:10,417
it would have been impossible.

1371
01:36:13,459 --> 01:36:14,834
Let us now resume the story

1372
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:17,084
from the point at which
you descended the ladder.

1373
01:36:17,167 --> 01:36:20,001
Madame Arlena
decided to avoid a confrontation

1374
01:36:20,126 --> 01:36:21,917
and was about to leave the beach

1375
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:25,751
when she noticed a small grotto
at the base of a cliff.

1376
01:36:26,542 --> 01:36:30,126
You may well ask
how I knew she had been in there.

1377
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:33,709
'Yesterday afternoon,
not only did I discover the false diamond

1378
01:36:33,834 --> 01:36:36,167
'that Sir Horace Blatt
had returned to her,

1379
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:40,292
'but my excellent wine taster's nose
had detected,

1380
01:36:40,417 --> 01:36:44,959
'not as you put it, Madame Castle,
a "pong", but <i>souffle de mer,</i>

1381
01:36:45,084 --> 01:36:46,834
'the breath of the sea,

1382
01:36:46,959 --> 01:36:52,042
'which, as you know, Monsieur Marshall,
was her favourite perfume.

1383
01:36:53,959 --> 01:36:56,542
But I am digressing.

1384
01:36:56,667 --> 01:37:00,667
You ran down onto the beach,
but Madame Arlena had disappeared.

1385
01:37:00,792 --> 01:37:02,459
Arlena!

1386
01:37:03,667 --> 01:37:05,209
Where are you?

1387
01:37:06,126 --> 01:37:07,459
I know you're here.

1388
01:37:09,667 --> 01:37:11,292
I want to talk to you!

1389
01:37:12,209 --> 01:37:14,001
Be with you in a minute.

1390
01:37:15,917 --> 01:37:17,209
Well, what is it?

1391
01:37:29,084 --> 01:37:32,234
Look here, Poirot. Haven't we heard
just enough of this blarney?

1392
01:37:32,334 --> 01:37:35,751
Arlena was not murdered with
a blunt instrument. She was strangled.

1393
01:37:35,876 --> 01:37:40,042
And if you would care to bend those
beady Belgian eyes on Christine's hands,

1394
01:37:40,167 --> 01:37:43,459
you'll see that they are too small
to have strangled anyone.

1395
01:37:43,584 --> 01:37:45,001
Yes, I quite agree.

1396
01:37:45,126 --> 01:37:48,126
In fact, that was a major stumbling block
to my theory.

1397
01:37:48,251 --> 01:37:51,751
Redfern's right. This knocks your theory
out of court, Monsieur Poirot.

1398
01:37:51,834 --> 01:37:55,917
Odell, please!
You weren't even there and I was.

1399
01:37:56,042 --> 01:37:58,834
Remember, I saw her lying there strangled.

1400
01:37:58,959 --> 01:38:00,917
Christine couldn't have done it.

1401
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:04,584
I'm absolutely of your opinion, madame.
In fact, she did not do it.

1402
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:09,501
The murder was committed by...
her husband, Patrick Redfern.

1403
01:38:11,209 --> 01:38:14,417
Now you really are
talking out of the top of your hat!

1404
01:38:15,126 --> 01:38:16,751
Oh, for God's sakes!

1405
01:38:16,876 --> 01:38:19,542
Patrick couldn't have done it,
any more than his wife.

1406
01:38:19,667 --> 01:38:21,917
Don't forget,
I was with him the whole time

1407
01:38:22,042 --> 01:38:26,501
between 11:30 and 12:00 when we came
into the bay and saw her lying there.

1408
01:38:26,626 --> 01:38:29,334
That is the whole point, madame.

1409
01:38:29,459 --> 01:38:33,376
'One moderately well-made young woman
is very much like another.

1410
01:38:33,501 --> 01:38:36,167
'Two brown arms, two brown legs

1411
01:38:36,292 --> 01:38:39,334
'and a little piece of bathing suit
in between.

1412
01:38:39,459 --> 01:38:43,876
'What exactly did you see from your
place in the boat, Madame Gardener?

1413
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:46,292
'The ardent young lover, Monsieur Redfern,

1414
01:38:46,417 --> 01:38:49,667
'bending over the body
with suntanned limbs

1415
01:38:49,792 --> 01:38:52,834
'wearing Arlena's white bathing costume

1416
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:55,959
'and a red Chinese hat.

1417
01:38:56,792 --> 01:38:59,209
'As I pointed out a couple of days ago,

1418
01:38:59,334 --> 01:39:02,084
'all bodies lying on the beach are alike.

1419
01:39:02,209 --> 01:39:04,126
"'They are not men and women", I said.

1420
01:39:04,251 --> 01:39:06,876
"'There is nothing personal
about them", I said.

1421
01:39:07,001 --> 01:39:11,959
"'They are like rows of butcher's meat
grilling in the sun", I said.

1422
01:39:12,084 --> 01:39:15,292
'No wonder you were fooled into imagining

1423
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:17,959
'that you had seen
the corpse of Madame Marshall,

1424
01:39:18,084 --> 01:39:20,167
'when what you had actually seen

1425
01:39:20,292 --> 01:39:23,792
'was the live body
of Madame Christine Redfern.

1426
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:27,501
'That is why the murderer
had to conceal the face,

1427
01:39:27,626 --> 01:39:31,417
'because it was not the murder victim
lying there, but somebody else.

1428
01:39:31,542 --> 01:39:36,417
'And who else would help
Monsieur Redfern, but his own wife?

1429
01:39:37,126 --> 01:39:41,417
'And now the performance
for the benefit of the witness is over.

1430
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:45,792
'Madame Gardener departs
from the bay by boat to fetch help.

1431
01:39:45,917 --> 01:39:49,459
'And what do you think happened,
Madame Gardener,

1432
01:39:49,584 --> 01:39:53,626
'as soon as you had disappeared?

1433
01:39:56,459 --> 01:40:00,542
'Why, the corpse leaps to her feet
and runs into the grotto

1434
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:03,376
'in order to remove
Madame Arlena's bathing costume,

1435
01:40:03,501 --> 01:40:06,209
'which she had stripped
off the unconscious woman.'

1436
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:09,292
And worn to play her part as a corpse.

1437
01:40:09,417 --> 01:40:13,251
I've got a point, Poirot,
which will scupper your whole case.

1438
01:40:14,001 --> 01:40:17,376
Christine is as pale as pasteurised milk.

1439
01:40:17,501 --> 01:40:22,917
The question is how could I have possibly
mistaken her arms and legs for Arlena's?

1440
01:40:23,042 --> 01:40:25,126
This covers nothing at all, madame.

1441
01:40:25,251 --> 01:40:29,084
In answer to your question, I would
ask you to consider the bizarre nature

1442
01:40:29,209 --> 01:40:32,542
of Madame Redfern's beach apparel.

1443
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:36,001
'When I saw Madame Redfern
in the lobby yesterday morning,

1444
01:40:36,084 --> 01:40:38,751
'she was wearing
a totally exaggerated garment,

1445
01:40:38,876 --> 01:40:42,209
'which completely covered her
from wrist to neck.'

1446
01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:46,709
No mere fear of the sun could have
occasioned such a choice of dress.

1447
01:40:46,834 --> 01:40:49,376
She had to wear
such an all-concealing outfit

1448
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:52,459
because underneath she was brown as a nut.

1449
01:40:53,584 --> 01:40:56,042
In the grotto, after having climbed

1450
01:40:56,167 --> 01:40:59,626
into the unconscious Madame Arlena's
swimming costume,

1451
01:40:59,751 --> 01:41:03,334
all she had to do
was to stain her hands and neck.

1452
01:41:03,459 --> 01:41:06,417
'Something she could not
have done earlier. Why?

1453
01:41:06,542 --> 01:41:09,459
'Ha-ha. Because Linda
would have noticed.

1454
01:41:09,584 --> 01:41:13,209
'She puts on the earrings

1455
01:41:13,334 --> 01:41:15,417
'and then she runs out of the grotto

1456
01:41:15,542 --> 01:41:17,334
'and onto the beach,

1457
01:41:17,459 --> 01:41:21,792
'settles herself on Arlena's towel

1458
01:41:21,917 --> 01:41:26,334
'and puts her great big Chinese hat
over her face

1459
01:41:26,459 --> 01:41:30,709
'and lies still to await the arrival
of her husband and yourself.

1460
01:41:30,834 --> 01:41:34,209
'Dead... on cue, as it were.

1461
01:41:35,792 --> 01:41:40,251
'And this, I must admit,
he stage-managed superbly,

1462
01:41:40,376 --> 01:41:42,251
'timing his appearance at Ladder Bay

1463
01:41:42,376 --> 01:41:46,959
'exactly to coincide
with the sound of a noonday gun.'

1464
01:41:53,417 --> 01:41:55,251
The rest was easy.

1465
01:41:55,376 --> 01:41:58,584
She now changed back
into her original costume.

1466
01:41:58,709 --> 01:42:00,917
It was about five past 12:00.

1467
01:42:01,042 --> 01:42:04,126
'Madame Redfern
bids her husband a hurried farewell.

1468
01:42:04,251 --> 01:42:06,042
'The clock is ticking.

1469
01:42:06,167 --> 01:42:08,667
'She runs back across the island
to rejoin the path

1470
01:42:08,751 --> 01:42:11,417
'leading from Gull Bay to the hotel.

1471
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:14,501
'Oh, she has one more task to perform.

1472
01:42:14,626 --> 01:42:18,417
'She must get rid of
the incriminating bottle of suntan stain.

1473
01:42:18,542 --> 01:42:21,792
'The bottle that no one
would admit throwing.

1474
01:42:21,917 --> 01:42:25,167
'So she hurls it over the cliff...

1475

'but has the bad luck to have the event
witnessed by Monsieur Brewster,

1476

'whom it almost hit.

1477
01:42:32,792 --> 01:42:36,126
'She reaches the hotel,
arriving there about 12:15.

1478
01:42:36,251 --> 01:42:38,209
'I myself timed the journey.

1479
01:42:38,334 --> 01:42:43,959
'But then I was not running
like a young gazelle, for obvious reasons.

heard by Monsieur Gardner,

'the bath no one would admit to taking,

1482

'in order to wash off the suntan.

1483
01:42:54,167 --> 01:42:55,876
'She changes into tennis clothes

'but unruffled and smiling,
a picture of innocence.'

1486
01:43:06,834 --> 01:43:08,584
Yes, Monsieur and Madame Redfern,

1487
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:13,626
I blame myself for not having seen
through your little charades earlier,

1488
01:43:13,751 --> 01:43:17,376
but then, unfortunately,
not even Hercule Poirot is perfect.

1489
01:43:18,126 --> 01:43:19,751
From the moment you arrived here,

1490
01:43:19,834 --> 01:43:23,584
you started playing out
a series of carefully rehearsed scenes,

1491
01:43:23,709 --> 01:43:27,084
'in such a manner
that all might hear or see.

1492
01:43:27,209 --> 01:43:30,001
'Together, there were scenes
of hysterical jealousy

1493
01:43:30,126 --> 01:43:31,917
'played close to open windows.'

1494
01:43:32,042 --> 01:43:34,917
- You don't want to talk!
- Now look here, Christine!

1495
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:38,418
I can't even speak to a pretty woman
without you jumping to the conclusion

1496
01:43:38,501 --> 01:43:40,751
that I'm, well, having an affair with her?

1497
01:43:40,876 --> 01:43:42,209
But you are, aren't you?

1498
01:43:42,334 --> 01:43:45,001
'A part, you, madame,
took every opportunity

1499
01:43:45,126 --> 01:43:48,001
'to give the impression
that you are a physically frail woman

1500
01:43:48,084 --> 01:43:52,417
'who's no good at sports and who had
to hide her skin away from the sun

1501
01:43:52,542 --> 01:43:56,001
'because it blistered
and made her look like, what was it?

1502
01:43:56,126 --> 01:43:58,167
'An Italian ice cream?

1503
01:43:58,292 --> 01:44:04,542
'And who was altogether to be pitied
as a poor little helpless abandoned wife.

'Whilst you, monsieur,

1505
01:44:06,251 --> 01:44:09,792
'took elaborately indiscreet pains

'instead of trying to conceal it
as any prudent lover would.'

1507
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:20,126
I think you will all agree
that it was a most audacious plan.

1508
01:44:20,251 --> 01:44:21,876
Brilliantly executed.

1509
01:44:22,001 --> 01:44:23,917
Oh, yes, brilliantly.

1510
01:44:24,042 --> 01:44:27,592
But the one thing you have failed
to supply, Monsieur Poirot, is motive.

1511
01:44:28,834 --> 01:44:31,251
Why on earth should I kill Arlena?

1512
01:44:32,126 --> 01:44:33,792
I absolutely adored her.

1513
01:44:36,042 --> 01:44:38,376
Oh, adultery may be reprehensible,

1514
01:44:38,501 --> 01:44:40,917
but it certainly is not criminal.

1515
01:44:41,042 --> 01:44:43,834
No, monsieur, you did not adore her,

1516
01:44:43,959 --> 01:44:45,876
you adored her money.

1517
01:44:46,001 --> 01:44:51,167
And, more especially, the magnificent
diamond offered her by Sir Horace Blatt.

1518
01:44:52,501 --> 01:44:56,959
Those who teach Latin to small boys
are not exactly overpaid.

1519
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:01,042
You're not at all the romantic figure
you like to present.

1520
01:45:01,167 --> 01:45:05,251
You are a hardened adventurer
and a vicious swindler,

1521
01:45:05,376 --> 01:45:08,417
who had absolutely no moral compunction

1522
01:45:08,542 --> 01:45:12,167
in borrowing the diamond
from Madame Arlena

1523
01:45:12,292 --> 01:45:16,501
and of substituting a paste copy.

1524
01:45:17,084 --> 01:45:19,667
Oh, pray, do continue, Monsieur Poirot.

1525
01:45:20,542 --> 01:45:24,834
Oh, yes, monsieur,
politeness is very much part of the act.

1526
01:45:24,959 --> 01:45:27,876
You knew that sooner or later
your deception would be discovered.

1527
01:45:27,959 --> 01:45:29,001
Too bloody right!

1528
01:45:29,667 --> 01:45:33,334
And you had to eliminate
the only witness capable of exposing you.

1529
01:45:33,459 --> 01:45:35,792
And what better opportunity
than on holiday,

1530
01:45:35,917 --> 01:45:38,834
in a small exclusive island,

1531
01:45:38,959 --> 01:45:42,376
where you could plan
and execute her murder?

1532
01:45:44,167 --> 01:45:47,334
'Picture to yourself the scene, <i>mes amis.</i>

1533
01:45:47,459 --> 01:45:49,042
'The half-lit grotto.

1534
01:45:49,167 --> 01:45:52,334
'Madame Arlena
slowly returning to consciousness

1535
01:45:52,459 --> 01:45:55,501
'and the so solicitous Monsieur Patrick

1536
01:45:55,626 --> 01:45:58,834
'preparing <i>le momentjuste</i> to strike.'

1537
01:45:58,959 --> 01:46:01,417
Oh, Patrick.

1538
01:46:03,876 --> 01:46:06,459
'Suddenly, his hands around her throat.

1539
01:46:06,584 --> 01:46:08,751
'She struggles

1540
01:46:08,876 --> 01:46:12,792
'and it is the end of poor, foolish,

1541
01:46:12,917 --> 01:46:18,167
'beautiful, gullible Arlena Marshall.'

1542
01:46:23,792 --> 01:46:28,251
And that, mesdames,
mademoiselle, messieurs

1543
01:46:28,376 --> 01:46:31,417
is the story of the murder
of Arlena Marshall.

1544
01:46:32,209 --> 01:46:34,542
The only thing they had not foreseen

1545
01:46:34,667 --> 01:46:39,209
was the presence on this island
of Hercule Poirot.

1546
01:46:45,292 --> 01:46:47,584
The well-known romancer
and teller of tales.

1547
01:46:47,709 --> 01:46:49,376
Excellent plot line.

1548
01:46:49,501 --> 01:46:51,209
Imaginatively conceived.

1549
01:46:51,334 --> 01:46:53,626
Good, clear narrative style.

1550
01:46:53,751 --> 01:46:55,792
I'll give you nine out of ten, Poirot.

1551
01:46:55,917 --> 01:47:00,751
I'm deducting one mark
for total absence of proof.

1552
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:04,501
Is that true?

1553
01:47:04,626 --> 01:47:08,376
We've sat here and listened to all that
and you can't prove a word of it?

1554
01:47:09,251 --> 01:47:10,959
Hmm.

1555
01:47:11,084 --> 01:47:14,876
Unfortunately, Monsieur Redfern
is absolutely right.

1556
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:17,126
I haven't a shred of evidence.

1557
01:47:17,251 --> 01:47:19,959
Although that is unquestionably
what happened.

1558
01:47:20,084 --> 01:47:22,792
Well, I don't think we need
to sit here and be insulted

1559
01:47:22,917 --> 01:47:25,792
by this fanciful little mountebank.

1560
01:47:26,542 --> 01:47:28,876
Come along, darling.
Shall we go and pack?

1561
01:47:31,126 --> 01:47:33,876
Er, just give us five minutes, Mr Poirot,

1562
01:47:34,001 --> 01:47:37,042
and I'm sure we'll be able
to work out how you did it.

1563
01:47:43,292 --> 01:47:46,417
After all, where were you
at the time of the murder?

1564
01:47:52,667 --> 01:47:56,584
You've let that pair get off scot-free
and I haven't even got my diamond back!

1565
01:47:56,709 --> 01:47:58,709
You've made a right cock-up, Poirot.

1566
01:48:52,376 --> 01:48:55,334
Oh, how very kind of you to see us off.

1567
01:48:55,459 --> 01:48:57,917
Oh, goodbye, my dear friends.

1568
01:48:58,626 --> 01:49:01,209
I don't think there'll be any necessity
to leave a forwarding address.

1569
01:49:01,292 --> 01:49:05,292
Oh, just a moment, Mr Redfern.
Haven't you forgotten something?

1570
01:49:06,459 --> 01:49:09,834
Why pay, Patrick?
They've done nothing but insult us.

1571
01:49:09,959 --> 01:49:11,876
Oh, we must pay it, darling.

1572
01:49:12,001 --> 01:49:15,651
After all, we wouldn't want anybody
to think we were cheats now, would we?

1573
01:49:18,126 --> 01:49:20,209
- I know you'll take a cheque.
- Certainly.

1574
01:49:20,292 --> 01:49:26,376
Of course, I also know that you're
thinking the cheque may well bounce.

1575
01:49:27,626 --> 01:49:32,042
But I'm afraid that's as good as it gets.

1576
01:49:35,084 --> 01:49:36,626
Here you are, dear.

1577
01:49:37,251 --> 01:49:40,292
I've put a little extra on
for the inconvenience.

1578
01:49:40,417 --> 01:49:42,251
Oh. Thank you so much.

1579
01:49:44,209 --> 01:49:47,459
Er, would you mind me
saying something, Miss Castle?

1580
01:49:47,584 --> 01:49:51,376
Your ensemble
does absolutely nothing for you.

1581
01:49:51,501 --> 01:49:52,792
Goodbye.

1582
01:49:54,084 --> 01:49:56,709
<i>Un instant, s'il vous plaît,
Monsieur Ruber.</i>

1583
01:49:57,751 --> 01:50:00,376
Monsieur Felix Ruber?

1584
01:50:00,501 --> 01:50:02,959
- Who did you say?
- Who the hell is Ruber?

1585
01:50:03,709 --> 01:50:06,667
Felix Ruber is the widower of Alice Ruber,

1586
01:50:06,792 --> 01:50:10,126
'whose strangled body had been
discovered on the Yorkshire moors

1587
01:50:10,251 --> 01:50:11,417
'some months ago.

1588
01:50:11,542 --> 01:50:14,667
'I was called in by
the Trojan Insurance Company

1589
01:50:14,792 --> 01:50:16,876
'to examine the police report.

1590
01:50:17,001 --> 01:50:19,376
'In the event of Mrs Ruber's death,

1591
01:50:19,501 --> 01:50:22,626
'her husband was a beneficiary
of a large sum of money.

1592
01:50:22,751 --> 01:50:27,084
'The police were satisfied that it was
the work of a madman or a tramp,

1593
01:50:27,209 --> 01:50:30,917
'and so was I, since the only
possible suspect, the husband,

1594
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:33,376
'had a cast-iron alibi,

1595
01:50:33,501 --> 01:50:37,042
'which had been established
by a woman hiker

1596
01:50:37,167 --> 01:50:40,042
'who had found the body
earlier in the day.

1597
01:50:40,167 --> 01:50:42,751
'But last night I asked myself.

1598
01:50:42,876 --> 01:50:47,834
'A strangulation, an innocent witness,
a change of time.

1599
01:50:47,959 --> 01:50:51,501
'Could the similarity in the pattern
of the events here on the island

1600
01:50:51,626 --> 01:50:54,834
'and those on the moors
be a mere coincidence?

1601
01:50:55,709 --> 01:50:56,917
<i>'Non, mes amis.</i>

1602
01:50:57,042 --> 01:51:00,917
'The lonely hiker was none other
than Madame Christine Redfern.

1603
01:51:01,042 --> 01:51:03,084
'While Monsieur Ruber was on a train,

1604
01:51:03,209 --> 01:51:05,751
'undoubtedly attracting attention
to his presence

1605
01:51:05,876 --> 01:51:08,959
'before potential witnesses.

1606
01:51:10,001 --> 01:51:12,501
'The bigamous Monsieur Ruber was now free

1607
01:51:12,626 --> 01:51:16,792
'to return to his surviving wife,
Madame Redfern.'

1608
01:51:21,126 --> 01:51:23,001
Oh, yes, monsieur, you were clever enough

1609
01:51:23,084 --> 01:51:25,792
to avoid putting your signature
in the hotel register,

1610
01:51:25,917 --> 01:51:29,584
but, you know, the signature on
this cheque is really quite good enough.

1611
01:51:30,584 --> 01:51:32,001
Different names, of course.

1612
01:51:32,126 --> 01:51:37,626
Here on the claim form
for Alice Ruber's insurance policy,

1613
01:51:37,751 --> 01:51:39,459
it appears as Felix Ruber,

1614
01:51:39,584 --> 01:51:42,792
and here on the hotel cheque
it appears as Patrick Redfern.

1615
01:51:42,917 --> 01:51:44,292
Different names,

1616
01:51:44,417 --> 01:51:49,376
but, monsieur,
undeniably the same handwriting.

1617
01:51:50,334 --> 01:51:52,876
My God.

1618
01:51:53,001 --> 01:51:56,376
You were wrong to tell me
that little joke about Giuseppe Verdi

1619
01:51:56,501 --> 01:51:59,126
being called Joe Green in English

1620
01:51:59,251 --> 01:52:03,042
or that you had once taught Latin
to small boys.

1621
01:52:03,167 --> 01:52:05,667
It was at that moment that I realised

1622
01:52:05,792 --> 01:52:11,292
that in that language
"Felix Ruber" is "Red Fern".

1623
01:52:12,667 --> 01:52:16,209
You see, it is folly
to try and trick Hercule Poirot,

1624
01:52:16,334 --> 01:52:18,292
even in a dead language.

1625
01:52:18,417 --> 01:52:20,668
Do you really think
anyone's going to believe the evidence

1626
01:52:20,751 --> 01:52:22,501
of a couple of scribbled signatures?

1627
01:52:22,584 --> 01:52:24,459
And your bloody silly word games?

1628
01:52:24,584 --> 01:52:29,167
Oh, monsieur, if my modest assumptions
are too fanciful for you,

1629
01:52:29,292 --> 01:52:34,001
then perhaps a photograph of a hiker
and the mourning husband,

1630
01:52:34,126 --> 01:52:36,209
which must have appeared
in the local papers

1631
01:52:36,292 --> 01:52:37,959
and which I of course have sent for,

1632
01:52:38,042 --> 01:52:40,126
will be enough proof to hang you, sir.

1633
01:52:40,251 --> 01:52:46,376
You will be arrested for the murder
of Alice Ruber and of Arlena Marshall.

1634
01:52:49,459 --> 01:52:53,792
But before that, there is a small favour
I would like to ask of you.

1635
01:52:59,084 --> 01:53:01,251
Would you smoke the pipe,

1636
01:53:01,376 --> 01:53:04,709
which has been conspicuous
by being unlit since you arrived here?

1637
01:53:06,792 --> 01:53:08,084
No?

1638
01:53:12,626 --> 01:53:14,292
<i>Dommage.</i>

1639
01:53:23,834 --> 01:53:25,292
As I thought.

1640
01:53:30,001 --> 01:53:34,001
Sir Horace, please be careful
to whom you give it next time.

1641
01:53:35,417 --> 01:53:37,709
My God, you're a wonder, Poirot.

1642
01:53:40,084 --> 01:53:41,417
Yes?

1643
01:53:43,876 --> 01:53:45,584
Poor Monsieur Poirot.

1644
01:53:45,709 --> 01:53:47,792
Brave Monsieur Poirot.

1645
01:53:47,917 --> 01:53:50,251
I've just had a telephone call
from His Majesty

1646
01:53:50,376 --> 01:53:52,167
and he is very pleased with...

1647
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:53,584
The King of Tyrania?

1648
01:53:53,709 --> 01:53:56,251
He's very pleased with the way
the matter's been cleared up so quickly

1649
01:53:56,334 --> 01:53:57,792
and so discreetly.

1650
01:53:57,917 --> 01:54:02,126
He's so pleased that he's awarding you
the Order of Saint Gudrun the Inquisitive.

1651
01:54:02,251 --> 01:54:05,126
- Saint Gudrun the Inquisitive?
- First class!

1652
01:54:06,542 --> 01:54:08,251
How many classes are there?

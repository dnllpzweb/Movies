1
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,099
<i>...what has
turned into a classic Formula 1 season.</i>

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,657
<i>With the weather conditions so uncertain,</i>

3
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,040
<i>the drivers prepare for...</i>

4
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,619
<i>...the track
is still dangerously wet,</i>

5
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,099
<i>but following a drivers' meeting,</i>

6
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,183
<i>- a decision has finally been taken.
- Three minutes to go.</i>

7
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,019
<i>Everybody off the grid now.</i>

8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,099
<i>Twenty-five drivers
start every season in Formula 1,</i>

9
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,183
<i>and each year two of us die.</i>

10
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,307
<i>What kind of person does a job like this?</i>

11
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,539
<i>Not normal men, for sure.</i>

12
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,784
<i>Rebels, lunatics, dreamers.</i>

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,861
<i>People who are desperate to make a mark</i>

14
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,221
<i>and are prepared to die trying.</i>

15
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,665
<i>My name is Niki Lauda,</i>

16
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,219
<i>and racing people know me for two things.</i>

17
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,986
<i>The first is my rivalry with him.</i>

18
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:42,887
<i>You want to change?</i>

19
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,064
<i>Photographers, please clear the grid.</i>

20
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,548
What about Hunt? Has he changed?

21
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,339
No, he's going on wets.

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,539
<i>I don't know
why it became such a big thing.</i>

23
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,908
<i>We were just drivers
busting each other's balls.</i>

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,419
<i>To me this is perfectly normal,</i>

25
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,659
<i>but other people saw it differently,</i>

26
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,584
<i>that whatever it was between us
went deeper.</i>

27
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,023
Then we go on wets too.

28
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,939
<i>The other thing I'm remembered for</i>

29
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,779
<i>is what happened on 1st August, 1976,</i>

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,379
<i>when I was chasing him</i>

31
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,539
<i>like an asshole.</i>

32
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,499
Trauma trolley, please.

33
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,979
Hello, I think the racetrack
telephoned ahead that I was coming.

34
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,425
Hunt. James Hunt.

35
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,583
What's the matter? No one ever seen
a spot of blood before?

36
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,591
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

37
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,657
We all thought you'd been in an accident.

38
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,787
I have.

39
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,290
If you call a friendly disagreement
with another driver an accident.

40
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,099
What did you disagree about?

41
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,670
It's none of your business.

42
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,782
Sorry.

43
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,145
His wife.

44
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,779
That's going to need a couple
of stitches. It's a nasty cut.

45
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,863
It was a nasty blow.
Done with a bloody crowbar.

46
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,545
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

47
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,381
Only what she asked me to do.

48
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,145
Which was...

49
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,306
I'd be happy to show you, if you like.

50
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,787
Oh! Sorry.

51
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,700
<i>I have a theory
why women like racing drivers.</i>

52
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,459
<i>It's not because they respect what we do,</i>

53
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,339
<i>driving round and round in circles.</i>

54
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,390
<i>Mostly they think that's pathetic,
and they're probably right.</i>

55
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,222
<i>It's our closeness to death.</i>

56
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,819
<i>You see, the closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.</i>

57
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,899
<i>The more alive you are.
And they can see that in you.</i>

58
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,823
<i>They feel that in you.</i>

59
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,221
<i>My name is James Hunt.</i>

60
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,379
<i>My father is a stockbroker,</i>

61
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,987
<i>my sister is a barrister
and my brother is an accountant.</i>

62
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,505
<i>And I...</i>

63
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,670
<i>Well, I do this.</i>

64
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,705
<i>It's a wonderful way to live.</i>

65
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,908
<i>It's the only way to drive.</i>

66
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,261
<i>As if each day is your last.</i>

67
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,099
I've never been to a Grand Prix before.

68
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,019
Oh, you still haven't.

69
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,546
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

70
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,699
It's a lower division,

71
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,226
where idiots like me mess about

72
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,379
in the hope of being talent-spotted
to race in Formula 1.

73
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,382
- You look disappointed.
- No.

74
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,139
Ah. You only slept with me
because you thought I was famous.

75
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,710
That's not true.

76
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,459
Don't worry. I will be one day.

77
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,099
Morning, everyone.

78
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,704
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

79
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,299
Nursie, this is Bubbles Horsley,
team manager.

80
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,381
How do you do?

81
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,579
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,659
- Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.
- How do you do?

83
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,585
And Alexander, Lord Hesketh,
the team's owner.

84
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,110
How do you do?

85
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,459
Fine, thanks.

86
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,419
Well done, Superstar.

87
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,946
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

88
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,789
Lotus 59.

89
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,631
1,000cc Cosworth MAE engine.

90
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,584
She's no beauty,
but goes like the clappers.

91
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:14,259
Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

92
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,419
Good sign, actually. Means he's stoked.

93
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,630
<i>All Formula 3 cars
to the assembly area now, please.</i>

94
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,549
<i>...drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now.</i>

95
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,510
All right, Superstar?

96
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,339
Never better, patron.

97
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,820
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

98
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,711
Quick toke of this.

99
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,510
<i>At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,</i>

100
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,659
<i>with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him</i>

101
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,379
<i>and Dave Walker completing Row 1.</i>

102
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,860
<i>Row 2 is Mike Beuttler and Dave Morgan,</i>

103
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,870
<i>- with Tony Trimmer and Gerry Birrell.</i>
- Who's that?

104
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,745
He's new.

105
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,139
- Some German.
- Austrian.

106
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,299
He's been here since 5:00 am,
walking the track.

107
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,739
You might actually
have to concentrate today, James.

108
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,344
You'll need these.

109
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,659
Okay, start her up.

110
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,179
Ah! What music!

111
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,739
They could never have imagined it,

112
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,027
those pioneers
who invented the automobile,

113
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,350
that it would possess us like this,
in our imaginations, in our dreams.

114
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,387
Nursie, men love women,

115
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,339
but even more than that,

116
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,662
men love cars.

117
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,943
- Come on, James!
- James! Come on, James!

118
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,351
Go, James!

119
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,259
<i>Hunt's still in the lead,</i>

120
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,422
<i>but Niki Lauda is right on his tail.</i>

121
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:11,099
<i>Hunt and Lauda are
proving to be in a class of their own.</i>

122
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,900
<i>They're leaving the pack far behind.</i>

123
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,704
<i>Herr</i> Red Devil's on his tail.

124
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,899
<i>Lauda takes a look down the inside...</i>

125
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,224
<i>...and he's sold him a dummy!</i>

126
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,742
<i>Lauda is through! He's in the lead!</i>

127
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,130
<i>Hunt will be determined
to make up for that mistake.</i>

128
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,310
<i>Hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.</i>

129
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,388
<i>Lauda's not leaving any gap.</i>

130
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,505
<i>The Lotus goes for the inside.
It's an aggressive move from Hunt.</i>

131
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,579
<i>Oh! There's contact!</i>

132
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,503
<i>The leaders have spun out!
Lauda's facing the wrong way!</i>

133
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,467
<i>The back marker's gone through.</i>

134
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:15,499
<i>You can see why Hunt's fellow drivers</i>

135
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,309
<i>call him "Hunt the Shunt".</i>

136
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,859
Asshole!

137
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,810
- Go on, James!
- The Kraut's out of it.

138
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,939
<i>Lauda is clearly furious.</i>

139
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,459
<i>There's every reason
to expect sharp words in the pits.</i>

140
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,349
<i>It's gonna be victory for Hunt.</i>

141
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,819
<i>It's gonna be an ignominious defeat
for Niki Lauda.</i>

142
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,459
<i>So James Hunt scores his
third major Formula 3 win of the season</i>

143
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,700
<i>here at Crystal Palace,</i>

144
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,619
<i>after a desperate battle with Niki Lauda.</i>

145
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,349
<i>Lauda was unable to restart</i>

146
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,217
<i>after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out</i>

147
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,700
<i>in the last lap of the race.</i>

148
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,580
Hard luck.
Better luck next time.

149
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,665
Hey, asshole.

150
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,979
That was my line. I had that corner.

151
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,257
Do you mean the one that you spun out of
and finished facing the other way?

152
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,739
I think that corner had you.

153
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,339
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

154
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,219
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

155
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,420
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

156
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,183
Fuck you. What's your name?

157
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,234
James Simon Wallis Hunt.
Remember it, my little Jerry friend.

158
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:27,219
<i>Jawohl.</i> Remember ze name.

159
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,059
And it's very simple. Hunt.
It rhymes with...

160
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,259
...cunt.

161
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,740
A word that happens
to describe you perfectly!

162
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,859
Who was that?

163
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,110
I've no idea.
He looks like a rat, doesn't he?

164
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,785
<i>In my home town, Vienna,</i>

165
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,542
<i>my family is famous
for one thing - business.</i>

166
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,387
<i>My grandfather was a businessman,</i>

167
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,305
<i>my father, too.</i>

168
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,299
<i>So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,</i>

169
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,109
<i>they had a few things to say.</i>

170
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,950
<i>Never!</i>

171
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,237
<i>Racing is for playboys and dilettantes.</i>

172
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:04,037
<i>Frivolous amateurs
with nothing in their heads.</i>

173
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:06,367
<i>The name Lauda...</i>

174
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:09,377
<i>belongs with politicians and economists,</i>

175
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,377
<i>on the front pages.</i>

176
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,877
<i>What if this is all I can do?</i>

177
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,967
<i>Then you need my money more than ever,</i>

178
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,257
<i>so do as I say and follow me
into the family business.</i>

179
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,585
<i>Gut.</i>

180
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,187
<i>Keep your money.</i>

181
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:30,477
<i>Don't invest in me.</i>

182
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:33,107
<i>But when I'm world champion</i>

183
00:11:33,477 --> 00:11:36,147
<i>and my name is on the front pages too...</i>

184
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,237
<i>you will regret it.</i>

185
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,151
<i>Get out and never show your face again!</i>

186
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,262
<i>So if my family wasn't going to help me,</i>

187
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,179
<i>I decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself.</i>

188
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,150
<i>I found a Formula 1 team with an okay car</i>

189
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,308
<i>and an owner who had run out of money</i>

190
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,582
<i>and was willing to accept my terms.</i>

191
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,664
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

192
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,619
I'm delighted to say

193
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,370
that the winner of the Guild of Motoring
Writers Award Driver of the Year...

194
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,341
is James Hunt.

195
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,705
Superb news!

196
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,622
- Well done, James.
- Superstar!

197
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,225
Fantastic!

198
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:20,139
Well done. Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

199
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,299
Yes!

200
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,659
Erm...

201
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,470
You know, my parents
always wanted me to be a doctor...

202
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,779
...or a stockbroker or something.

203
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,539
They gave me the first-class education,

204
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,699
but, well, that all went terribly wrong

205
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,580
and I ended up with you lot.

206
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,440
Thank you. I need it more than you do.

207
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,866
I mean, I have a hot head,
an inability to tolerate discipline.

208
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,345
- Yes!
- Very true.

209
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,960
I fall out with people left and right.

210
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,659
The only creatures I've ever really
loved or have treated honourably

211
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,662
are budgerigars.

212
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,985
So in any normal area of life I'd be...
or I am, a total liability.

213
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,737
The only thing I've got going for me
is I'm quick in a car.

214
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,819
So, thank you for this
and for acknowledging that.

215
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,339
I'm going to give it to my father

216
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,179
and tell him to put it on the mantelpiece

217
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,630
and imagine it's a first-class degree
in medicine.

218
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,739
Well done, Superstar.

219
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,377
Another season like that
and I'll move you up to the big time.

220
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,099
Come on, you don't think I'm ready now?

221
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,468
You are. I'm not.
I've got to find you a car first.

222
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,019
Well, go on, then. Chop-chop.

223
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,379
Don't wait too long. You don't want him
to do what Lauda just did.

224
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,419
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive with BRM.

225
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,699
Well, how the hell did he do that?
He's a nobody.

226
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,219
He's never won a bloody thing.

227
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,219
Apparently, took out a loan
and bought his way in

228
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,939
with two million Austrian schillings.

229
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,385
Jesus.

230
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,949
Niki Lauda.
Here for pre-season testing. BRM?

231
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,270
Sign the release form.
I'll let them know you're here.

232
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,579
- Mr Stanley.
- Good morning.

233
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,579
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Clay!

234
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,339
Let me introduce you
to our number-one driver,

235
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,342
Clay Regazzoni.

236
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,469
- How are you?
- Good.

237
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,224
- Pleasure.
- And these are your mechanics.

238
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,299
They're reporting exclusively to you,
as per contract.

239
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,139
Pleasure. Do you wanna see the car?

240
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,585
Sure.

241
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,031
Hello.

242
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,506
There she is. P160.

243
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,906
- Same as Regazzoni's?
- Identical in every detail.

244
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,350
How much does she weigh?

245
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,106
- 600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

246
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,979
- Why so heavy?
- It's a V12 engine.

247
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,179
That lump weighs 190K on its own.

248
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,179
Okay.

249
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,539
What horsepower are you getting? 490?

250
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,019
- No, no, 450.
- Well, it's not enough.

251
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,499
It needs to be 500,

252
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,259
and the engine
needs to be 20 kilo lighter.

253
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,579
We already tried.

254
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,857
- Tried what?
- Everything.

255
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,499
We replaced the entire exhaust system.

256
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,788
- Barely made a difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

257
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,339
Now the engine block.

258
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,071
Any mounting or fixing plates,
strip it out also.

259
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,539
When you've done that,
we have to look at the aerodynamics,

260
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,304
front and rear wing.

261
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,822
Okay, thank you. Good night.

262
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,225
What was Regazzoni's time?

263
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,511
1:53.

264
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,779
Okay, now put him in my car,
and he'll go round two seconds faster.

265
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,829
- Well, that's impossible.
- No chance.

266
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,219
We've been working on it all night.

267
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,339
Put Regazzoni in the car.
See what happens.

268
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,259
I don't understand.
Why am I supposed to do this?

269
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,210
I don't know, Clay.
He just wants you to take it for a spin.

270
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,059
Gloves, please.

271
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,505
<i>'fanculo.</i>

272
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,819
- I would say we push it a bit...
- All right.

273
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,899
What did you do to the car?

274
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,427
That's information I will share with you
under certain conditions only.

275
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,105
Go on.

276
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,864
A guaranteed place in the team,

277
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,370
and a paid contract on equal terms
with Regazzoni for two years.

278
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,584
Are you crazy?

279
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,227
Clay's a senior figure in Formula 1.
You're just a rookie.

280
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,337
Well, the only reason we took you on
is because you're paying us.

281
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,739
Well, as of now, if you want me to stay,
we rip up the contract.

282
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,471
- I don't pay you a cent.
- That's outrageous!

283
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,062
Was he quicker in my car?

284
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,782
He was, wasn't he?

285
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,741
Did he go two seconds faster?

286
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,825
2.3.

287
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,668
So, have a think,

288
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,541
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

289
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,951
Hey, Niki.

290
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,257
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

291
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,341
What?

292
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,062
If it's the track manager
you're taking on your date tonight...

293
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,739
It's none of your business.

294
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,506
Okay, but if you want my advice,
I'd let this one go.

295
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,501
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

296
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,099
Agnes's last boyfriend
was a British Formula 2 driver

297
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,499
who has a reputation for two things.

298
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,185
For being a little crazy on the track,

299
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,504
and for going all night and all day
and all night again in bed.

300
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,139
He's a good driver,
but an immortal fuck, apparently.

301
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,340
I don't know about you, but
that's not an act I'd like to follow.

302
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,502
But if that doesn't bother you...

303
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,390
What's his name, the driver?

304
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,145
Hunt. James Hunt.

305
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,707
You see, you share information
and I share information.

306
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,267
That's what teammates are for.

307
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,059
<i>Where the hell are we going?</i>

308
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,419
<i>I promise it'll be worth it.</i>

309
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,865
<i>Just keep them closed.</i>

310
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,745
Wait for it.

311
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,389
Wait for it.

312
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,186
There. What do you say?

313
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,870
She's Formula 1.

314
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,984
Yes, she is, Superstar.

315
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,299
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

316
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,779
And since the economics of F1

317
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,419
are not so significantly different
to the economics of Formula 2,

318
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,857
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

319
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,059
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in Formula 1.

320
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,382
You fat, little, inbred beauty.
Come here.

321
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,022
Actually, credit where it's due,
we got the idea from Niki.

322
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,299
- Who?
- Lauda.

323
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,139
Bought his way in, rather than
mess about in the lower divisions.

324
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,857
I thought, "Bloody hell, he's right."

325
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,419
No sponsorship, Superstar.
I hope you approve.

326
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,425
No vulgar logos for cigarettes or condoms.

327
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,028
Just plain white with the flags. Ooh!

328
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,430
And racing overalls which read,

329
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,219
"Sex. Breakfast of champions."

330
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,709
So, when do we start?

331
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,867
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

332
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,751
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

333
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,779
- Hi, welcome to Watkins Glen.
- Hello!

334
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,777
<i>When the season started, people wondered</i>

335
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,810
<i>whether Lord Hesketh and his team
of upper-class enthusiasts</i>

336
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,499
<i>were bringing glamour
to the racing community, or just comedy.</i>

337
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,659
Certainly, it was the first time
anyone had seen

338
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,299
a butler serving oysters and caviar
in the pits.

339
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,139
But they have made quite an impact.

340
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,379
Sixth in France, fourth in Britain
and third in Holland.

341
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,059
<i>All drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.</i>

342
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,234
<i>A severe crash at the Esses.</i>

343
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:18,339
<i>Red flag.
There is a car off the track.</i>

344
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,099
And reports are reaching me

345
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,431
that there has been
a serious accident in qualifying.

346
00:22:22,514 --> 00:22:25,259
Er, the identity of the driver we don't
currently have at the moment,

347
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,467
but, as you can tell from all the activity

348
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,259
going on behind me towards the track,

349
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,739
it is clearly a grave incident indeed.

350
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,219
We will, of course,
have more information for you

351
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,297
as and when we get it,

352
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,385
but it is the sight and sound
of Formula 1 nobody likes to see.

353
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,330
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey, come on.

354
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:55,739
<i>Drivers of top stature</i>

355
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,539
<i>we've lost just in the past four seasons</i>

356
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,459
<i>have included Piers Courage, Jochen Rindt,</i>

357
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,819
<i>Jo Siffert, Roger Williamson</i>

358
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,099
<i>and today, at Watkins Glen,</i>

359
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,421
<i>Formula 1 has claimed another driver.</i>

360
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,307
<i>The Tyrrell team
have withdrawn from the race.</i>

361
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,139
<i>Their places on the grid
will be left empty.</i>

362
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,586
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

363
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,345
Why?

364
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,106
He made a mistake,
went into the corner too fast.

365
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,699
It's his fault.

366
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,589
- Is that right?
- It's obvious.

367
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,709
Look at the tyre marks.

368
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,419
So says the nobody
who had to pay for his own drive.

369
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,217
How's that working out for you,
by the way?

370
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,110
Fine. How is it at the back?

371
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,102
Not planning on being there for long.

372
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,579
<i>Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.</i>

373
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,099
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

374
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,431
<i>Asshole.</i>

375
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,785
Arsehole.

376
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,539
<i>Heading into
the Grand Hotel hairpin, second gear.</i>

377
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,619
Turn in hard,

378
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,271
looking for late apex,
gentle with the bar.

379
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,149
Heading into Portier, second gear,
clip the apex,

380
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,821
light brake, stay in second,
looking for a good exit.

381
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,299
Heading through the tunnel, gradual right,

382
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,339
up through third, fourth, fifth...

383
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,342
Is Alexander round?

384
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,539
Er, yes, he was.

385
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,219
He went back to the house to take a call.

386
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,059
He'll be back shortly.

387
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,222
He only wanted to show me
his pride and joy.

388
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,979
Rhymes with "boy", if you ask me.

389
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,859
And "toy".

390
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,139
God, it's so flimsy
for something that costs so much.

391
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,219
There's no comfort,
no protection, nothing.

392
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,939
No, it's just a little coffin, really.

393
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,059
Surrounded by high-octane fuel in here.

394
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,059
Being driven round 170 miles per hour.

395
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,223
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

396
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,303
You're James, aren't you?

397
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,030
Yes.

398
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,709
You fit the description.

399
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,511
Is that right?

400
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,708
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

401
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,949
Yeah, yeah. I know exactly.

402
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,179
What was the description?

403
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,779
Mostly positive, in terms of appearance.

404
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,987
Negative only in terms of character.

405
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,423
I've been told to avoid you.

406
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,231
By whom?

407
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,579
Alexander. He says you're a bad boy.

408
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,939
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

409
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,379
I was. I'm not any more.

410
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,979
The new me is very professional.
Early to bed, early to rise.

411
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,619
- All very dull.
- Hmm.

412
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,059
But according to the team,

413
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,741
"The best way to
keep beating the goose-stepper."

414
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:36,139
Is that what you were doing
when I came in?

415
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,179
Yes, visualisation techniques,
memorising the circuit,

416
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,865
in this case Monaco, which is up next.

417
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,899
Personally, I've always been a great
believer in getting there on the day,

418
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,850
putting my foot down
and playing chicken with everyone else.

419
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:56,219
But they don't want me
doing that any more.

420
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,305
They want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk.

421
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,179
And what about your soul, your heart?

422
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,419
Well, they've got ideas about that, too.

423
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,019
They want me to stop messing around,
settle down,

424
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,339
get married
with the next nice girl I meet.

425
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,090
They think it would be good for me.

426
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,222
Hmm. What do you think?

427
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,902
It sounds fucking awful.

428
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,387
But since they're right about most things,

429
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,379
- they're probably right about that, too.
- Hmm.

430
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,781
You don't fancy getting married, do you?

431
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,705
Suzy.

432
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,831
Bravo!

433
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,103
Hey, hey, hey!

434
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,857
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

435
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,390
Didn't want to ruin your day.

436
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,341
It's... It's the Kraut.

437
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,190
What about him?

438
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,979
He's just been signed by Ferrari.

439
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,701
You're kidding me?
Jesus. How did that happen?

440
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,497
Did he buy his way in there, too?

441
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:25,219
Well, the old man took Regazzoni back
and he insisted on it, apparently.

442
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,620
He says that Niki's a genius
setting up the cars.

443
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,264
It's terrible. Drives like a pig.

444
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,467
- Oh, you can't say that.
- Why not?

445
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,868
- It's a Ferrari!
- It's a shitbox.

446
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,779
It understeers like crazy and
the weight distribution is a disaster.

447
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,430
It's amazing, all these facilities
and you make a piece of crap like this.

448
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,659
Uh!

449
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:14,897
We are happy
to welcome back to the Ferrari family...

450
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:17,357
our good friend Clay Regazzoni,

451
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,777
and to introduce Niki Lauda,

452
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,487
from Austria.

453
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,539
"Ferrari family."
"Our good friend Clay Regazzoni."

454
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,099
You are family and friend
to the commendatore as long as you win.

455
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,737
The minute you don't, ciao, ciao.

456
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,950
I totally understand. It's business.
I would do the same.

457
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,059
But it isn't
just business, is it? What we do.

458
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,219
It's passion, love.

459
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,059
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

460
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,179
Not me.

461
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,977
If I had more talent and could earn
better money with something else,

462
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,739
I would.

463
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,419
How do you know you will
make money here? You haven't yet.

464
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,741
Not yet, but I will.

465
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,309
If you can, I can.

466
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,080
You know, are you ever not an asshole?

467
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,419
- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

468
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,019
You know, by now I'm both quicker than you

469
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,939
and better at setting up the car.

470
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,779
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

471
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,941
Screw you.

472
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,139
I brought you along today because
you seem like a lonely kind of guy.

473
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,099
I thought if I introduced you
to some nice people,

474
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,979
that could rub off on you.

475
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,699
Forget it. Make your own friends.

476
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,385
Come on, Clay. I'm sorry.

477
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,345
Are you leaving?

478
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,871
Yes.

479
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,099
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

480
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,600
anywhere with a train station?

481
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,423
Sure. Trento's half an hour's drive.

482
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,107
Get in.

483
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,907
<i>Been another blue day without you, girl</i>

484
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,547
<i>Been another sad summer song</i>

485
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,305
<i>I been thinking about you, girl,
all night long</i>

486
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,341
What are you doing?

487
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,657
You hear that noise when you accelerate?

488
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,027
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

489
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,899
My What?

490
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,379
And when you brake,
your foot goes all the way down,

491
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,057
which means there's air in the system.

492
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,711
- Anything else?
- No.

493
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,465
Apart from the rear brakes are worn out,

494
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,259
the front right tyre's a bit soft,

495
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,059
which explains why you're weaving so much.

496
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,540
Hmm. How can you tell?

497
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,868
- My ass.
- Sorry?

498
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,979
God gave me an okay mind,

499
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,830
but a really good ass,
which can feel everything in a car.

500
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:34,339
You don't know what
you're talking about. This car is fine.

501
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,139
- I just had a service a week ago.
- Not a good one.

502
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,791
Yes, a very good one, very expensive.

503
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,499
This car is as good as new. Relax.

504
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,339
Not in a hurry, are you?

505
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,099
No. As long as I'm back

506
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,500
in Maranello Monday morning.

507
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,750
We can speak German.

508
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,179
- You're from Vienna, aren't you?
- <i>Ja.</i>

509
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,460
- Marlene.
- Niki.

510
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,742
How do you know Curd?

511
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,307
Who's Curd?

512
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,607
Curd Jürgens, the host.

513
00:32:21,227 --> 00:32:24,147
He is, or was, my boyfriend.

514
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:28,607
There is something very attractive
about an older man.

515
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,247
But when they behave
like a frightened child...

516
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,235
I must have been mad.

517
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:36,945
<i>Let me do this.</i>

518
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:40,995
Otherwise we'll never get out of here.
We're in Italy, after all.

519
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,360
Not bad, eh?
Three seconds. Admit it, you're impressed!

520
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,631
<i>Mi scusi... Tu sei Niki Lauda?</i>

521
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,779
Yes.

522
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:21,619
Do you need a lift?

523
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,099
- Actually, we do, yeah.
- Okay.

524
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,379
It's my honour, Niki, please.

525
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,621
- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

526
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,539
On one condition, though.
It's a piece of shit. It's dog shit.

527
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,623
But if you drive it,
you make my life, Niki, eh?

528
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:43,347
No one will believe
Niki Lauda is driving my granny's car.

529
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,588
- Niki Lauda!
- Niki Lauda, Niki Lauda!

530
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,899
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

531
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,419
Who are you? Should I know you?

532
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,910
What, you don't know?

533
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,499
He's Niki Lauda, Formula 1 driver,
and he just signed with Ferrari.

534
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,990
- Him?
- Yes.

535
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,307
- Impossible.
- Why?

536
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,979
Well, you know, Formula 1 drivers,
they have long hair, are sexy,

537
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,499
their shirts are open to here.

538
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,259
- Thank you.
- Yes.

539
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,662
Anyway, look at the way he's driving,
like an old man.

540
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,440
There's no need to drive fast.

541
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,750
It just increases the percentage of risk.

542
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,660
We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

543
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,699
Right now, with zero incentive or reward,

544
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,464
why would I drive fast?

545
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,302
Because I'm asking you to.

546
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,819
And do you always get what you want?

547
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,151
<i>Ja.</i>

548
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:43,867
Usually.

549
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,859
<i>This is an incredible battle</i>

550
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,339
<i>between Niki Lauda in the red Ferrari</i>

551
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,866
<i>and James Hunt in the white Hesketh.</i>

552
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,539
...the challenge of Niki Lauda...

553
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,059
<i>Lauda attacking Hunt.</i>

554
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,869
<i>Lauda gets through on the inside.</i>

555
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,505
<i>Goes wide at the exit.</i>

556
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,219
<i>Hunt is past again.</i>

557
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,379
<i>Once more
Lauda tries to sneak up the inside.</i>

558
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,459
<i>They're absolutely side by side,
wheel to wheel.</i>

559
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,539
<i>So evenly matched. Fantastic battle
between these two great drivers.</i>

560
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,907
<i>Hunt is now ahead once more.</i>

561
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,059
<i>But Lauda's coming back again now.
Lauda once more sneaks up the inside.</i>

562
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,540
<i>And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...</i>

563
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,863
- Suzy, we're ready, come on.
- Just... Just one second.

564
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,391
- Can we go, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

565
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,979
<i>We're in the closing laps
of this race here at Watkins Glen.</i>

566
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,180
<i>They come down the hill.</i>

567
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,419
<i>And Hunt's got a problem!</i>

568
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,899
<i>Hunt pulls across to the left.</i>

569
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,744
<i>Lauda goes ahead on his own.</i>

570
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,900
<i>A sad end to a wonderful battle.</i>

571
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,591
<i>Hunt pushing off the marshal.</i>

572
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,105
<i>The chequered flag
is waiting for Lauda and for Ferrari.</i>

573
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,259
<i>The title going to Niki Lauda,</i>

574
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,779
<i>who wins the race,</i>

575
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,260
<i>who wins the World Championship.</i>

576
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,625
Do I look like a racing driver now?

577
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,070
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

578
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,339
Marlene.

579
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,699
With a car like that, the rest of us
never really stood a chance, did we?

580
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,697
Maybe the fact the car is so good
has something to do with me.

581
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,670
Come on, Niki. You're in a Ferrari.
I'm in a Hesketh.

582
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,739
Equal terms, the way it was in Formula 3,

583
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,186
- I'd beat you and you know it.
- Never.

584
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,300
You might win one race, maybe two,
because you're aggressive.

585
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,503
But in the long run, over the course
of a season, no chance.

586
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,667
Right. Why's that?

587
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,737
Because to be a champion,
it takes more than just being quick.

588
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,579
- It's the whole picture.
- Oh.

589
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,619
You're just a charger and a party guy.

590
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,170
That's why everybody likes you.

591
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,760
Try saying that
and tell me you're not jealous.

592
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,505
Why would I be jealous? Think about it.

593
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,019
All that affection, all those smiles

594
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,859
- is a sign of disrespect.
- Oh.

595
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,379
They don't fear you.
Whereas compare that to me.

596
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,031
Yes, compared to you, whom no one likes.

597
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,779
- Right.
- Not even his own teammates.

598
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,545
Right. Because I'm a serious guy.

599
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,097
I go to bed early,
I look after myself, look after my car.

600
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,229
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

601
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,097
And then, after the race,
I go home instead of going to bars

602
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,379
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

603
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,299
Arseholes?

604
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,746
You should go home more often, too.

605
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,062
I heard you got married.

606
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,664
Yes, I did.

607
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,826
So where is she, this mysterious wife?

608
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,022
- In New York, working.
- Oh.

609
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,419
You know,
I've never seen you with her once.

610
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,660
No?

611
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,979
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

612
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,905
on your own, looking after yourself,
being a good little boy.

613
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,431
Take a drink on me, James.

614
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,946
Thank you, Niki. I might just have two.

615
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,819
Right, Bubbles,

616
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,949
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year, just say it.

617
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,471
Your word is my command.

618
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,062
There are no lengths
to which I will not go. I mean it.

619
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,463
What the hell's going on?

620
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,226
Where is everybody? What's the matter?

621
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,379
Do you know what the date is today?

622
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,826
Yes, it's November, the 14th. Why?

623
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,504
Do you have any idea
of the significance of that date?

624
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,983
I don't know.
Time to start killing pheasants?

625
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,139
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

626
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,063
for the forthcoming Formula 1 season.

627
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,745
Yes?

628
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,090
Which elapsed at midnight last night,
and we didn't attract any.

629
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,939
Well, so?
We aren't looking for sponsorship.

630
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,540
Like you said, condoms and cigarettes,
vulgar, right?

631
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,386
Right.

632
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,307
Except we are, or were.

633
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,546
I've made something of a miscalculation.

634
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,982
The economics, Formula 1,
realities thereof.

635
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,543
It turns out,
not like the lower divisions at all.

636
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,789
What are you saying?

637
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,180
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

638
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,547
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

639
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,741
Probably have to sell this place.

640
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,342
Oh, Christ.

641
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,746
I need a drive, Pete.
I need you to find me a drive.

642
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,705
I mean, what about Lotus?

643
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,265
You don't wanna know.

644
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,231
- Actually, I do.
<i>- Okay. Uh...</i>

645
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,582
They felt your reputation preceded you.

646
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,659
And what does that mean?

647
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,269
It's my other line.
Look, I'll get back to you.

648
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,261
Peter Hunt.

649
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,190
Fuck.

650
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,820
Don't worry. Something will turn up.

651
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,308
Doubt that will help in the meantime.

652
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,979
Why don't we go away at the weekend?

653
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,109
Skiing. Before I go back to New York.

654
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,142
Talk to me, James.
Don't make a stranger of me.

655
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,299
You know, Suzy,
only a stranger would invite me skiing

656
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,746
when they know
I haven't got a fucking drive.

657
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,904
I can't watch this.

658
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,981
What were you hoping for anyway?

659
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,819
A well-adjusted knight in shining armour?

660
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,819
No danger of that.

661
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,179
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

662
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,019
Don't go to men who are willing
to kill themselves driving in circles

663
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,671
- looking for normality.
- I never expected normality.

664
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,939
God knows I walked into this
with my eyes open.

665
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,499
I just hoped I'd married someone

666
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,617
who was half as impressive
on the inside as he is on the outside.

667
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,499
At least there's something
behind the facade.

668
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,707
- Oh, James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

669
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,259
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

670
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,160
that needs your vapid mush to flog it.

671
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,219
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, James.</i>

672
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,542
It's Peter. Something's up at McLaren.

673
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,219
<i>- What have you heard?</i>
- Nothing. Why?

674
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,746
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

675
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,579
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

676
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,981
Say anything, just get me in that room.

677
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,739
I'll come straight to the point.

678
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,259
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

679
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,579
...has ditched us for another team
at the last minute.

680
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,939
- Coper-fucking-sucar.
- And we need a replacement.

681
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,430
ASA-fucking-P.

682
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,266
Fortunately, a few hands
have already gone up, good people.

683
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,785
- Jacky Ickx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

684
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,179
- But he's consistent, dependable.
- A grown-up.

685
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,627
Right, and will he go for that gap
when no one else will?

686
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,937
Will he put his life on the line
the day that it really matters?

687
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,465
The sponsors like him.

688
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,179
What do you want,
a driver or a brush salesman?

689
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,180
- We wanna be successful.
- Yes, so do I.

690
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,379
But that means beating Niki Lauda,
not being a show pony for sponsors.

691
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,939
I heard about this thing with Niki.

692
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,146
Everyone has.

693
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:45,859
- You really think you can beat him?
- I'd beat him in a McLaren.

694
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,148
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

695
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,462
Which is why I'm here, begging.

696
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,459
Look, I'll do whatever you ask.

697
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,337
I'll put on a tie,
I'll smile for sponsors,

698
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,309
say the right things.

699
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,941
I can beat this guy, trust me.

700
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,669
Just give me the drive.

701
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,269
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, he can be a loose cannon.</i>

702
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,139
And, yeah, he will drive you all mad,

703
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,667
but in terms of raw talent
and right stuff,

704
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,730
there is no better driver in the world.

705
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,222
<i>He's the real thing, Teddy.</i>

706
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,874
<i>- He's what we all came into this for.</i>
- Mmm.

707
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,979
Nine days out of ten
you'll be pulling your hair out,

708
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,179
but on that tenth day,
James will be unbeatable.

709
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,377
And that is the day you will wish
you had him in your car.

710
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,304
<i>You will never win the championship
with Jacky Ickx.</i>

711
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,099
You just might with James.

712
00:46:53,155 --> 00:46:55,659
Welcome to São Paulo, Brazil,
and the Interlagos circuit

713
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,301
for the first race
in the 1976 Formula 1 season,

714
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,779
where the main news is that James Hunt
has qualified fastest,

715
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,897
beating Niki Lauda's Ferrari
to pole position

716
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,711
by just two hundredths of a second.

717
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,304
New car.

718
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,790
- I noticed.
- Pole position.

719
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,219
I noticed that, too.

720
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,699
Level playing field now,
my ratty little friend.

721
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,379
Yeah. Let's see where we are
after lap one.

722
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,190
Let's see where we are
in five races' time.

723
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,219
Hunt has the pit lane pole position,

724
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,670
which should give him the best chance
of out dragging Lauda's Ferrari.

725
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,739
If ever there was a doubt about

726
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,059
whether Lauda had
a serious challenger to this season,

727
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,701
Hunt and his McLaren
have certainly given us the answer.

728
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,939
<i>Here in South Africa,</i>

729
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,942
<i>James Hunt is determined to make amends</i>

730
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,064
<i>after that disastrous retirement
in Brazil.</i>

731
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,619
<i>But it's Lauda who takes the flag
here at Kyalami.</i>

732
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,339
<i>James Hunt comes home second</i>

733
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,859
<i>to confirm his championship
challenge at last</i>

734
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,619
<i>and score his first points</i>

735
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,190
<i>of the season.</i>

736
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:18,626
That wind you can feel
is me breathing down your neck.

737
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,742
Next time I'll have you.

738
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,111
We'll see in Spain.

739
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,459
<i>James Hunt finally takes
his first victory of the season</i>

740
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,986
<i>here in Spain, after a brilliant drive.</i>

741
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,307
It was only a matter of time.

742
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,470
Luca, don't you think it's time
to tell them?

743
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,501
- It's too wide.
- Disqualified.

744
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,339
- What?
- You're disqualified.

745
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,024
How can we be disqualified?

746
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,019
- 1.5 centimetres.
- It's the same car.

747
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,182
<i>Giustissimo.</i>

748
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,501
You fucking...

749
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,499
<i>...McLaren M23
has proved very controversial here.</i>

750
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,377
Just make it narrower. I don't care how.

751
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,539
New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

752
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,350
I wanna make sure
this thing is legal, no doubts.

753
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,939
Well, then we'd better move the
oil coolers back to the old position.

754
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,179
With the oil coolers back, the
wing brackets need to be changed, too.

755
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,379
Fuck.

756
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,539
What the fuck d'you think we're doing?

757
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,699
<i>And with Hunt disqualified
from his Spain win,</i>

758
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,379
<i>his championship year is not going well.</i>

759
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,906
<i>And now it's all gone wrong
here at Monaco!</i>

760
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,219
<i>His engine is smoking.</i>

761
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,911
Smoke pouring
from the engine of that McLaren!

762
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,539
And James Hunt is out!

763
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,059
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Sure. It's magic.

764
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,299
We've taken a great car,
a great piece of engineering,

765
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,509
and overnight turned it into
a big, huge, stinking turd.

766
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,831
Shit!

767
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,579
What the hell have you done?
The car's evil.

768
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,339
It's fucking undriveable!

769
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,259
James, look, if there's a problem
with the car we'll find it...

770
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,339
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

771
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,417
- We are appealing it.
- We will sort it out.

772
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,579
- They're killing us out there.
- Go and get your dick wet.

773
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,419
- You're a wanker.
- Fuck you.

774
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,670
- You're a fucking wanker.
- I will, arsehole.

775
00:50:53,475 --> 00:50:55,179
But this was a good race for you,
no, Niki?

776
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,280
It's good for everyone

777
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,297
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

778
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,137
James, you're 50 points
behind Lauda in the championship.

779
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,667
You've had another retirement today.
What's going wrong?

780
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,779
Oh, it's dirty politics and dirty tricks,

781
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,191
that's what's going wrong.

782
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,859
<i>So, as we approach the halfway point</i>

783
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,624
<i>in this year's Formula 1 season,</i>

784
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,459
<i>Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top,</i>

785
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,509
<i>and James Hunt and McLaren are struggling.</i>

786
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,067
So, five races in, how's it going so far?

787
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,703
It's fine. Just got a little problem
with an Austrian rat

788
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,459
and his team of Italian cheats

789
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,979
- who have destroyed my car.
- What are you talking about?

790
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,177
I'm talking about the race in Spain
that I won.

791
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,497
- Yeah, in a car which is not legal.
- Five-eighths of an inch too wide.

792
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,857
You know that doesn't have
the slightest effect on speed.

793
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,377
But you complained and your team
of lawyers leaned on the authorities.

794
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,659
Now we've had to rebuild the car,
and it's become a monster.

795
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,857
- At least it's a legal monster.
- You've had to resort to cheating.

796
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,501
You're driving an illegal car
and call me the cheat? It's pathetic.

797
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,899
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

798
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,981
Thank you. Thank you.

799
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,019
Do you really think it upsets me, James,

800
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,019
calling me a rat because I look like one?

801
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,749
I don't mind it.

802
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,739
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody likes them,

803
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:12,499
but they're very intelligent and
they have a strong survival instinct.

804
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,184
- Wonderful.
- Marlene, <i>komm.</i>

805
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,859
Leave this jerk alone.

806
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,305
No wonder she left him.

807
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,670
Anyone seen Suzy?

808
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,859
She's supposed to be here today.

809
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,023
We, er... didn't wanna tell you
before the race.

810
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,550
Tell me what?

811
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,345
Jesus.

812
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,585
Is that from him?

813
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,591
Yeah.

814
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,262
So when did all this start?

815
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,787
That weekend I went skiing.

816
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,867
Why have you come here, James?

817
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,865
I've come to get you back.

818
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,949
You don't want me back.

819
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,779
You never wanted to be married
in the first place.

820
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,101
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

821
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,259
You did it because
you hoped it might change you,

822
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,160
settle you down, help with the racing.

823
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,711
No, I didn't.

824
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,099
And who knows?
If it had been just the drinking

825
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,939
or the dope or the infidelity
or the moods,

826
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,240
it might even have worked.

827
00:54:02,435 --> 00:54:04,779
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

828
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,623
No, you're not terrible.

829
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,783
You're just who you are
at this point in your life.

830
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,784
God help anyone who wants more.

831
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,663
And Richard Burton,
will he able to give you more?

832
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,790
You know, he has quite
the bad boy reputation himself.

833
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,311
What's important is how it feels to me,

834
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,747
and it feels like he adores me.

835
00:54:36,835 --> 00:54:38,739
- James!
- New York Times!

836
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,259
Are you and Suzy getting back together?

837
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,259
- James, how do you feel...
- It's all very amicable.

838
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,819
My wife has found herself a new backer...

839
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,419
I mean, lover, which makes her happy.

840
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,019
And Mr Burton has found
a way of feeling young again,

841
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,499
which makes him happy.

842
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,859
Let's hope his pockets are deep.
They'll need to be.

843
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,179
And I've found a way to be single
and have an ex-wife

844
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,939
without it costing me a penny,

845
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,179
which has got to go down
as the biggest win of my career.

846
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,911
I have a flight to catch.

847
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,299
<i>We haven't seen this sort of intensity</i>

848
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,979
<i>from James Hunt all season long.</i>

849
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,979
Reports have been coming out
of the McLaren camp all week

850
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,462
that their car is now fully legal
and faster than ever.

851
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,470
Never mind the bloody wets.
We're still quick.

852
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,862
Hunt has really closed the gap on Lauda
as they head into Druids.

853
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,859
<i>Niki Lauda is under real pressure
from James Hunt</i>

854
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,511
<i>as they go up the hill into Druids Corner.</i>

855
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,183
And Hunt is in front of Lauda!

856
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,097
<i>So James Hunt gets the plaudits</i>

857
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,059
<i>of the crowd, the first Briton to win</i>

858
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,737
<i>a British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch</i>

859
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,709
<i>since Jim Clark in 1964.</i>

860
00:57:36,235 --> 00:57:38,379
James, at the moment
you've got a terrific edge

861
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,580
over the rest of the field.
How have you achieved this advantage?

862
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,419
Big balls.

863
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,910
Would you...

864
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,099
<i>Following an inquiry
into the disqualification</i>

865
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,501
<i>of driver James Hunt
from the Spanish Grand Prix,</i>

866
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,099
<i>it has been decided</i>

867
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,099
<i>- to overturn this disqualification...</i>
- Yes!

868
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,579
<i>...and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.</i>

869
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,259
James! James!

870
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,137
James, a few weeks ago
you were out of the running

871
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,099
for the season completely,
and now you're right back in it.

872
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,099
- What's changed?
- Well, it's a combination of factors

873
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,259
not all of which I'm prepared
to discuss here

874
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:18,584
but justice being done
re the disqualification in Spain helps,

875
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,146
and having my car back at its best again.

876
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:23,775
In theory it's possible

877
00:58:23,776 --> 00:58:26,021
for James Hunt to catch you.
Are you worried?

878
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,336
Not at all.

879
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,296
For him to catch me,
he would have to win a lot of races...

880
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:32,740
and pigs would have to fly.

881
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,177
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a family matter to attend to.

882
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,750
James! James!

883
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:52,303
I should warn you.
I'm not going to be any good at this.

884
00:58:53,317 --> 00:58:56,027
"Bringing flowers" and "holding hands".

885
00:58:56,277 --> 00:58:59,866
I'll probably forget your birthday.

886
00:58:59,867 --> 00:59:03,207
But if I'm going to do this with anyone,

887
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:06,747
it might as well be you.

888
00:59:08,207 --> 00:59:09,337
My God...

889
00:59:09,457 --> 00:59:11,547
a poet!

890
01:00:22,407 --> 01:00:24,697
What's the matter?

891
01:00:30,247 --> 01:00:32,917
Happiness is the enemy.

892
01:00:34,377 --> 01:00:36,297
It weakens you,

893
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:40,257
puts doubts in your mind.

894
01:00:42,467 --> 01:00:45,807
Suddenly, you have something to lose.

895
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:55,187
When you call happiness an enemy,

896
01:00:56,857 --> 01:00:59,527
then it's too late.

897
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,537
Then you've already lost.

898
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,467
Welcome to the legendary Nürburgring.

899
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,063
This is a 14.2-mile track,

900
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:17,908
complete with 185 corners and bends.

901
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,099
Niki, an autograph?

902
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,511
Yep.

903
01:02:01,127 --> 01:02:02,637
With the date, please.

904
01:02:02,797 --> 01:02:04,137
The date? Why?

905
01:02:04,297 --> 01:02:06,347
You never know.
Could be your last.

906
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,779
<i>Welcome to the Nürburgring,</i>

907
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,386
<i>The most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.</i>

908
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,510
In Formula 1 it is known as the Graveyard.

909
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,377
The weather conditions are far from ideal,

910
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,030
and latest reports indicate

911
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,819
there is no relief in sight.

912
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:39,699
Gentlemen. Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

913
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,862
Thank you. Niki Lauda.

914
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,585
Thank you.

915
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,703
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

916
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,019
the Nürburgring is the most stupid,
barbaric, outdated

917
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,539
and dangerous track in the world.

918
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,859
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

919
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:57,579
Now, those of you with experience know
the ring needs perfect conditions

920
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,231
to be even remotely acceptable
in terms of risk.

921
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,737
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

922
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,979
so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race.

923
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,062
Cancel the race?

924
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:10,219
There would be no change to the situation

925
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,699
as far as points is concerned.

926
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,419
- The race would simply be cancelled.
- This is bullshit.

927
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,739
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

928
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:21,179
That's true, you leave without your fee,
but you might leave with your life.

929
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:25,424
It also means that you would
effectively win the championship.

930
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,386
So, I can see why
this suits you just fine.

931
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,351
Why? There would be
no points for me either.

932
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,059
No, but there would be one race less

933
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,499
where I, or anyone else here,
could catch you.

934
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,859
James is right. This is just tactics.

935
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,545
Maybe he's just frightened.

936
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,585
Which asshole said this?

937
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:53,429
Yes, of course I'm frightened,
and so are you.

938
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:59,379
I accept, every time I get in my car,
there is 20 per cent chance I could die,

939
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,950
and I can live with it,

940
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,099
but not one per cent more.

941
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,421
And today, with the rain,
the risk is more.

942
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,440
I suppose that all depends
on how good you are in the rain.

943
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,619
I have the track record here.

944
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,579
I am the only person in history
to do the ring in under seven minutes.

945
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,265
So, actually, it's to my advantage
to race here today.

946
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,301
Because I'm quicker than all of you.

947
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,628
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

948
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,657
- Come on, Niki, let's race.
- Gentlemen, please.

949
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,459
Why are we here, Niki? Come on.

950
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,311
Well, all those in favour
of cancelling the race.

951
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,264
All those in favour of racing.

952
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,105
Gentlemen, the race is on.

953
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,101
- Ridiculous.
- What a waste of time.

954
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,600
You know, Niki, every now and then
it helps if people like you.

955
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,859
In places
the track is still dangerously wet,

956
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,379
but following a drivers' meeting,

957
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,979
a decision has finally been taken.

958
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,219
The Grand Prix will go ahead.

959
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:36,904
The race is going ahead.

960
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,379
Niki!

961
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,144
<i>One minute to go.</i>

962
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:56,859
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

963
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:59,419
- Is Niki gonna change?
- No.

964
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,502
Then we stay on wets, too.

965
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,104
- Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

966
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:16,060
All right, fire her up.

967
01:06:29,274 --> 01:06:32,059
<i>This season's fight for
the Formula 1 World Championship</i>

968
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,739
<i>has so far been the story of two men.</i>

969
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:39,419
<i>Thus far, it's been going
pretty much the way of Niki Lauda.</i>

970
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,105
<i>But James Hunt has qualified fastest here.</i>

971
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,299
<i>He is on pole position
for the German Grand Prix,</i>

972
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,383
<i>with Niki Lauda alongside
in the blood-red Ferrari.</i>

973
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,299
<i>It's a long race.</i>

974
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,951
If the track starts to dry out,

975
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,904
the wet-weather tyres
will no longer be as quick.

976
01:07:18,315 --> 01:07:20,419
Niki Lauda and James Hunt, side by side

977
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:23,583
on the front row of the grid,
go away absolutely as one.

978
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,987
<i>Lauda very aggressive on Hunt there,</i>

979
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,102
<i>forcing the McLaren onto the grass.</i>

980
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,939
<i>Lauda has the lead at the moment.</i>

981
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,307
Lauda leads into the first corner.

982
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,468
<i>Hunt is in second place.</i>

983
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,779
<i>Mass storming past Hunt!</i>

984
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:02,630
<i>He made the right choice
to go with the dry-weather tyres.</i>

985
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,789
<i>Mass passing Lauda now!</i>

986
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:09,825
<i>Jochen Mass, in the number 12 McLaren,
takes the lead!</i>

987
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,664
Jochen Mass the clear leader,

988
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,868
with everybody else making the decision

989
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,139
to change tyres
after just one lap of this race.

990
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,347
He's coming in! Come on, let's go!

991
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,550
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should have taken my advice.

992
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,499
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

993
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,185
Behind you.
He made the same mistake.

994
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,669
Come on!

995
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:54,029
Come on! What's going on?

996
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:58,899
The tyre-changing frenzy has caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack,

997
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,870
- with Jochen Mass in the lead now.
- You're clear. Go!

998
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,546
Quick!

999
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,859
Lauda urging his mechanics to hurry.

1000
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:08,160
Quicker, quicker, quicker!

1001
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:11,862
It's a disaster! Come on!

1002
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,990
What's going on, you assholes?

1003
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,979
This race has gone wrong for him so far.

1004
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:54,427
<i>His championship rival, James Hunt,
is a long way up the road.</i>

1005
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,779
<i>Lauda passing car after car.</i>

1006
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:10,262
<i>He's just going past
Mario Andretti's Lotus there.</i>

1007
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:58,982
Niki!

1008
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:06,062
Get me out! Help me!

1009
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:09,260
<i>We have an accident
on the course. Red flags are out.</i>

1010
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,300
<i>Several cars are involved. Looks like
it might be one of the Ferraris.</i>

1011
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,867
- Come this way.
- Come on, come on!

1012
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,579
Keep trying.

1013
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,820
- Come this way.
- Okay.

1014
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:58,187
<i>News is reaching us that Niki Lauda
was involved in the accident.</i>

1015
01:11:58,267 --> 01:12:04,237
<i>He is being flown by helicopter
to Mannheim hospital with severe burns.</i>

1016
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:41,790
<i>It's not
the burns to his face that are the danger.</i>

1017
01:12:42,857 --> 01:12:44,857
<i>It's the burns to his lungs.</i>

1018
01:12:47,607 --> 01:12:49,834
In the intensive care unit,

1019
01:12:49,835 --> 01:12:52,891
six doctors and thirty-four
nurses are on duty for him.

1020
01:12:54,077 --> 01:12:57,367
But his condition is far worse
than originally feared.

1021
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,619
<i>The flood, which swept
down Big Thompson Canyon in Colorado,</i>

1022
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,339
<i>was the worst since records began.</i>

1023
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,939
<i>In Formula 1 today,
victory celebrations were muted</i>

1024
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,779
<i>after a horrific accident involving
world champion Niki Lauda.</i>

1025
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,779
<i>Due to safety concerns before the race,</i>

1026
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,179
<i>the Austrian had said
he would not take part,</i>

1027
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,670
<i>but in the end he did.</i>

1028
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,377
<i>He was making up for lost time
when he went off the track,</i>

1029
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,827
<i>puncturing the Ferrari's fuel tank.</i>

1030
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,577
<i>Brett Lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck,</i>

1031
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:53,659
<i>but was unhurt and joined with
the other drivers to rescue Lauda,</i>

1032
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,550
<i>who was taken to Mannheim Hospital
with severe burns,</i>

1033
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:00,301
<i>the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.</i>

1034
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,499
<i>Niki Lauda was trapped for almost a minute</i>

1035
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,151
<i>in a searing inferno of 800-plus degrees.</i>

1036
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,259
- Do we have any change this morning?
- No...

1037
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,183
<i>Frau</i> Lauda. <i>Frau</i> Lauda?

1038
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,182
He's awake and just spoke.

1039
01:14:22,787 --> 01:14:26,377
He said, "Tell the priest to fuck off!
I'm still alive!"

1040
01:14:26,547 --> 01:14:28,207
You can go in.

1041
01:15:49,957 --> 01:15:54,547
<i>James Hunt gains on the absent Niki Lauda.</i>

1042
01:16:01,717 --> 01:16:03,787
<i>We need to vacuum the lungs.</i>

1043
01:16:04,566 --> 01:16:07,260
<i>I should warn you. It won't be easy.</i>

1044
01:17:16,337 --> 01:17:17,717
Do it again.

1045
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:22,121
Are you sure?
The lungs will already be bruised.

1046
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,904
- Niki...

1047
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:06,137
Please, stop.

1048
01:18:07,137 --> 01:18:10,687
I know what you're thinking, but please...

1049
01:18:12,017 --> 01:18:15,317
If you love me, you won't say a word.

1050
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,890
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

1051
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,670
Looking good.

1052
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,779
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

1053
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,828
- What about him?
- He's here.

1054
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,665
- What?
- He's racing.

1055
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:22,670
Niki.

1056
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,825
It's that bad, huh?

1057
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,551
No.

1058
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:37,419
In hospital I asked them straight,
no bullshit,

1059
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,263
how bad my appearance would be.

1060
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,867
They said with time it would be fine.

1061
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,344
But it won't.

1062
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,104
I can tell, seeing your reaction.

1063
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:53,360
I will spend the rest of my life
with a face that frightens people.

1064
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:00,946
You know, Niki, I tried to write you
a letter at the time, to apologise.

1065
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,060
The drivers' meeting in Germany,
before the race.

1066
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,706
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

1067
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,107
That race should never have gone ahead.

1068
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,464
No, it shouldn't.

1069
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,619
So, in many ways, I feel responsible
for what happened, and...

1070
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,190
You were.

1071
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:21,589
But, trust me...

1072
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:26,790
watching you win those races
while I was fighting for my life...

1073
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,309
...you were equally responsible
for getting me back in the car.

1074
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,745
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

1075
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:06,779
Niki, can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you've had

1076
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,782
and the expectations for your recovery?

1077
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:10,785
Sure.

1078
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,779
I had a skin graft operation,

1079
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:15,101
where they put half my right thigh
in my face.

1080
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:22,139
Now, it doesn't look too good,
but one unexpected advantage is

1081
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,499
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

1082
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,000
so sweat will never run into my eyes
again, which is good for a driver.

1083
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,819
When they heard about your condition,

1084
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:35,267
Ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver, Carlos Reutemann.

1085
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:39,979
Yeah, before even reaching the hospital.

1086
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,028
Is Reutemann driving today, too?

1087
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:45,464
Yes, and keen to make an impression.

1088
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:49,659
So, let's see where Mr Reutemann
finishes and where I finish today.

1089
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:54,330
James Hunt and McLaren have
caught up a lot while you were away.

1090
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,990
Yes.

1091
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,870
So is there a question now,
or are you just trying to piss me off?

1092
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,629
You still think you can win?

1093
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,859
Yes, of course.

1094
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,862
I have the better car.

1095
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:11,460
And possibly I'm the better driver.

1096
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:14,139
But he's a clever guy,
and he's used his time well

1097
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:18,190
while I was lying half-dead in hospital
to win some points.

1098
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,825
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

1099
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:32,579
She said, "Sweetie,
you don't need a face to drive."

1100
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,708
"You just need a right foot."

1101
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,387
I'm being serious.

1102
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:42,063
Do you really think your marriage can
survive with the way you look now?

1103
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,748
And I'm being serious, too.

1104
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:50,710
Fuck you. Press conference over.

1105
01:22:55,395 --> 01:22:57,739
- That was hairy.
- Well, you got noticed, Clive.

1106
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,099
I'll tell you that.

1107
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,779
I thought it went well, to be honest.

1108
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,579
They don't like it
when it's not going their way.

1109
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,264
- Clive.
- That's the game.

1110
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,699
- See you.
- See you later.

1111
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,617
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

1112
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:10,459
Listen, I think I've got something for you

1113
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:12,259
on that last question, about Niki.

1114
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:14,866
You heard about that?
I did.

1115
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,829
James.

1116
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,631
Please, James...

1117
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:30,544
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

1118
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,391
Prick.

1119
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:56,141
So Niki Lauda, just 42 days after
his near-fatal accident at Nürburgring,

1120
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:57,819
will race here today at Monza

1121
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:01,586
against all medical advice
and no doubt in incredible pain.

1122
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,019
<i>...Niki Lauda!</i>

1123
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:47,061
<i>Photographers, please clear the grid.</i>

1124
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,462
Niki, it's time.

1125
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,470
Okay?

1126
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,551
<i>Please clear the grid.</i>

1127
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:05,308
<i>One minute to go.</i>

1128
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:46,347
That's a bad start for Lauda,
he's slow away.

1129
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:54,019
<i>The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.</i>

1130
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,466
<i>He's being overtaken by car after car.</i>

1131
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,026
A terrible start for the Austrian.

1132
01:26:01,027 --> 01:26:03,427
<i>It's perhaps too soon for him
to be racing again.</i>

1133
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:09,389
<i>Lauda's off line.
He runs wide onto the grass.</i>

1134
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:15,970
<i>He wrestles it back onto the track,</i>

1135
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:18,910
<i>but that was a bad moment for Niki.</i>

1136
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:25,059
<i>Niki Lauda's the reigning world champion,</i>

1137
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:28,269
<i>but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,</i>

1138
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:31,230
<i>to himself and to the rest of the field.</i>

1139
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:37,111
<i>And Stuck has collided
with Mario Andretti's Lotus!</i>

1140
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:40,423
<i>Niki's boxed in. He's got nowhere to go.</i>

1141
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:58,421
<i>Niki Lauda is actually
making a move. He's on Brambilla's tail.</i>

1142
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,351
<i>He pulls out of the slipstream
to overtake.</i>

1143
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,421
<i>Lauda's starting to find the form</i>

1144
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:09,890
<i>that, early in this race,
we believed he'd lost.</i>

1145
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:20,025
Lauda's now lapping faster than
Reutemann and closing the gap ahead.

1146
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:26,511
<i>Lauda closing on Carlos Reutemann,</i>

1147
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:29,783
<i>the man called in to be his replacement
in the Ferrari team.</i>

1148
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,629
<i>And there's James Hunt's McLaren,</i>

1149
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:43,186
<i>smoking stationary
by the side of the road.</i>

1150
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:49,903
<i>This is bad news for Hunt's
championship hopes.</i>

1151
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,711
<i>It's Ronnie Peterson</i>

1152
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,187
<i>who comes home the winner here at Monza.</i>

1153
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:01,330
<i>But all eyes are on the man
who finishes a brilliant fourth,</i>

1154
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:04,348
<i>Niki Lauda!</i>

1155
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,619
<i>What a race, what a man, what a season.</i>

1156
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:49,859
With a fourth-place finish
and three priceless points,

1157
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,899
it means that Niki Lauda
is a major step closer

1158
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:54,107
to retaining the World Championship.

1159
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:56,819
<i>So, the long, gruelling
and incredibly dramatic season</i>

1160
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:59,259
<i>comes down to this final race in Japan</i>

1161
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,859
<i>in the shadow of Mount Fuji.</i>

1162
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,339
<i>Niki Lauda goes into</i>

1163
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:04,859
<i>this deciding race at Fuji</i>

1164
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:07,099
<i>just three points ahead of James Hunt.</i>

1165
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:11,389
<i>Hunt knowing he must beat the Austrian
fair and square to take the title.</i>

1166
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:16,499
James, do you think
you can cope with the pressure?

1167
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:20,027
Well, I've never really understood
what that means. I love my job.

1168
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:22,188
I love competing. I love racing.

1169
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:24,299
<i>Maybe you should ask Niki.</i>

1170
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,659
He's the World Champion.
He's got everything to lose.

1171
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:29,059
Mr Lauda, are you feeling pressure?

1172
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:31,506
Do I look like I'm feeling pressure?

1173
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:37,710
I am World Champion, and on the verge
to become World Champion again.

1174
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:39,899
Hunt now has the opportunity to win,

1175
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:42,059
but it's not so easy to become a champion.

1176
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:45,189
You have to really believe it
to make it possible.

1177
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,417
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1178
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:51,499
If Niki is being tricky and getting
a kicky out of playing mind games...

1179
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,867
...then fine, I'm flattered.

1180
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:57,541
But the fact is, momentum is with me.
I've never felt better.

1181
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:00,257
And I fully expect the next
press conference we will have

1182
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:02,502
will be with me as World Champion.

1183
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:06,859
How will you cope
with the weather, bad conditions?

1184
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:10,419
Intermittent heavy rain
has been forecast here at Fuji today,

1185
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:13,902
along with strong winds and occasional fog

1186
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:15,909
rolling in from the mountain.

1187
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:20,419
<i>And so, with today's
Japanese Grand Prix to come,</i>

1188
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:22,259
<i>Lauda's lead a mere three points.</i>

1189
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,944
<i>What a way to finish the season.</i>

1190
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:26,099
<i>Hunt or Lauda?</i>

1191
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:29,137
<i>Well, the final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage...</i>

1192
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:32,339
They've got to cancel the race.
It's lethal out there.

1193
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:34,539
The race is going ahead.

1194
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:36,459
Television rights have been sold
all around the world.

1195
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:39,179
The showdown between you and Niki
is all anyone wants to see.

1196
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:42,659
With heavy rain
continuing to fall here at Fuji,

1197
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,742
a decision has finally been made.

1198
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:48,859
The 1976 Japanese Grand Prix
will go ahead.

1199
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:51,545
<i>All drivers to your cars, please.</i>

1200
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:17,591
<i>Five minutes to go.</i>

1201
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:02,299
- All right?
- All right.

1202
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,699
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

1203
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:06,499
To let the condensation out.

1204
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:09,299
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

1205
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:11,667
Trust me,
this race is all about the start.

1206
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:16,151
- Need a hand here?
- Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

1207
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:32,270
Okay, start the bastard.

1208
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:36,910
Good luck, kid.

1209
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:39,711
Good luck, James.

1210
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:21,262
<i>Thirty seconds to go.</i>

1211
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:42,939
<i>Electric tension here at Fuji.</i>

1212
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:48,059
<i>80, 000 bedraggled race fans and
the racing grudge match of the decade.</i>

1213
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,259
<i>And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,</i>

1214
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,262
<i>James Hunt alongside him.</i>

1215
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:56,419
<i>On Row 2 of the grid,</i>

1216
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:58,379
<i>there is Niki Lauda,</i>

1217
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:00,899
<i>and on Row 3 of the grid,
Jody Scheckter from South Africa</i>

1218
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,419
<i>in the six-wheel Tyrrell.</i>

1219
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,502
<i>Behind him, the rest of the 25-car field.</i>

1220
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:26,345
There's the flag, and finally
the Japanese Grand Prix is underway!

1221
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:41,819
<i>In these conditions,
it must be almost impossible to drive</i>

1222
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,822
<i>a 450-horsepower car.</i>

1223
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:14,059
<i>And it's Andretti who has the lead,
but Hunt is attacking.</i>

1224
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:17,099
<i>Hunt's going round
the outside of Andretti.</i>

1225
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:18,739
<i>Niki Lauda following him through.</i>

1226
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:21,505
<i>Hunt leads into the first right-hander.</i>

1227
01:37:04,035 --> 01:37:06,379
<i>Hunt comes through
to complete his first lap,</i>

1228
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:07,859
<i>leading the field.</i>

1229
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,017
<i>At least he has clear vision
in front of him.</i>

1230
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,262
<i>Niki Lauda, behind him, eating his spray.</i>

1231
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:33,219
<i>Lauda is slowing.</i>

1232
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:36,179
<i>Niki Lauda is bringing
the Ferrari number one into the pit.</i>

1233
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:41,110
<i>Some sort of problem, we can't
imagine what, so early in the race.</i>

1234
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:50,827
What's wrong with the car?
What's wrong with the car?

1235
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,709
Niki, what's wrong with the car?

1236
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:56,142
Nothing. Car's perfect.

1237
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,979
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping.

1238
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:05,219
<i>His mechanics
are asking what the problem is.</i>

1239
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:07,541
<i>But wait!
Niki Lauda's getting out of the car!</i>

1240
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:09,339
This is sensational!

1241
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:12,340
The reigning World Champion,
Niki Lauda, is out of this race.

1242
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:14,939
It's too dangerous.

1243
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:18,540
Niki, you want me to say there was
a problem with the car, for the media?

1244
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:20,950
No.

1245
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,751
Tell them the truth.

1246
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:25,190
<i>Now, what is happening?</i>

1247
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:29,225
<i>They're talking to the team manager.
Lauda explaining something.</i>

1248
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:48,139
<i>With Lauda out, James Hunt
knows he has to finish this race</i>

1249
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:51,979
<i>in third place or higher
to be World Champion.</i>

1250
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:54,739
<i>But the job's not done yet for James Hunt.</i>

1251
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:59,348
<i>In these dreadful conditions,
he still has to go the distance.</i>

1252
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,303
<i>Fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.</i>

1253
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:04,579
<i>James Hunt or Niki Lauda?</i>

1254
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:07,739
<i>This extraordinary season is not over yet.</i>

1255
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:11,187
<i>In this treacherous final round,
can James Hunt hang on?</i>

1256
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:13,619
<i>And the scoreboard tells a story.</i>

1257
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:16,430
<i>Lap 58. Hunt in the lead.</i>

1258
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:20,370
Oh, God, his tyres, they're blistering.

1259
01:39:21,675 --> 01:39:23,739
<i>Brambilla very close behind now,</i>

1260
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,708
<i>closing on him all the time now.</i>

1261
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:29,059
<i>And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.</i>

1262
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:31,586
<i>Hunt cuts across the orange March nose.</i>

1263
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:34,059
<i>Hunt's not having that at all.
And he's spinning.</i>

1264
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:37,299
<i>He missed Hunt there, but almost
took James Hunt out of the race</i>

1265
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,739
<i>and out of the world championship.</i>

1266
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:42,471
<i>Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.</i>

1267
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:48,988
<i>Mario Andretti's going past Hunt!</i>

1268
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:52,464
<i>Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.</i>

1269
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,139
<i>Despite these wet conditions,</i>

1270
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:01,897
<i>these wet-weather tyres
do wear extremely fast.</i>

1271
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:04,108
Hunt's tyres, they've gone.

1272
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:08,026
<i>Hunt nursing his car back to the pit stop.</i>

1273
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:12,068
<i>That back marker's going past Hunt.</i>

1274
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:27,259
<i>Look at that left front tyre...
Right front tyre, sorry.</i>

1275
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:30,423
<i>No tread on it at all.
And the other one is flat.</i>

1276
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:32,708
Let's go! Let's go!

1277
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:39,739
Okay? When did you break
your gear lever?

1278
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:41,419
Nine or ten laps ago.

1279
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:43,866
- Alastair, we need to lift it.
- Come on!

1280
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,739
- At the front.
- Let's go.

1281
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:49,019
<i>Regazzoni's Ferrari
and Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier</i>

1282
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:50,670
have gone ahead.

1283
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:52,459
Come on, hurry!

1284
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:55,579
You did it.
You're going to be World Champion!

1285
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,099
Not yet.

1286
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:00,939
<i>A few laps ago, James Hunt
was looking like champion elect.</i>

1287
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:03,440
<i>Now it looks as though
it's all gone wrong for him.</i>

1288
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:06,219
- James.
- Come on!

1289
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:07,739
- Listen.
- What?

1290
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:10,059
Just go easy out there.

1291
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:14,099
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

1292
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:16,059
We want you back in one piece.

1293
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:19,499
You're too far back. There's
too many drivers in front of you.

1294
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:23,505
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

1295
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:25,459
Clear!

1296
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:26,985
James.

1297
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:30,583
- Clear!
- Fuck it!

1298
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:37,819
James Hunt rejoins the race
in sixth position.

1299
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:41,711
<i>There are four laps left to go.
Surely no way back for the Brit now.</i>

1300
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:02,914
Concentrate, Superstar.

1301
01:42:02,915 --> 01:42:04,819
<i>Just brings it back under control.</i>

1302
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:06,099
<i>Sliding the McLaren</i>

1303
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:07,340
<i>on the very edge there.</i>

1304
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:10,546
<i>Hunt's M23</i>

1305
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,339
<i>twitching this way and that under braking.</i>

1306
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:13,777
And he almost loses it right there.

1307
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:16,581
<i>Hunt on the tail
of Jacques Lafitte in the blue Ligier.</i>

1308
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:25,951
Oh, don't do it, James.

1309
01:42:29,075 --> 01:42:31,019
<i>He's inches away from the pit wall.</i>

1310
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,829
<i>He's inches away from the Ligier.</i>

1311
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:44,339
<i>James Hunt has made up another place,</i>

1312
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:45,419
<i>but it's not enough,</i>

1313
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:46,870
<i>and this race is running out.</i>

1314
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:57,702
<i>And Watson has spun.
Watson has spun.</i>

1315
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:05,179
<i>Hunt manages to weave his way
between that back marker</i>

1316
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:07,259
<i>and the stationary Penske.</i>

1317
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:09,339
He's catching Regazzoni

1318
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:11,059
but, in these conditions,
it's one thing to catch up,

1319
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:13,267
it's quite another to overtake.

1320
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:20,790
<i>He's alongside Clay Regazzoni.
This could be the world championship.</i>

1321
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:30,745
<i>He's got him!</i>

1322
01:43:31,207 --> 01:43:34,247
The scoreboard
still shows Hunt in 5th place.

1323
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:48,179
<i>Hunt crosses the line.</i>

1324
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:51,859
<i>Now, he needed to finish third to score
enough points to be World Champion,</i>

1325
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:56,459
<i>and in the confusion here, we're being
told that he may have finished fifth.</i>

1326
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:58,659
He finished fifth?

1327
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:01,539
<i>Our lap charts show Hunt in third place.</i>

1328
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:03,539
<i>Well, if the scoreboard's right,</i>

1329
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:06,139
<i>it means he's just missed out
on the championship.</i>

1330
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:09,781
<i>Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.</i>

1331
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:16,339
I can see the race stewards conferring,

1332
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:18,059
examining the official lap charts.

1333
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:20,810
<i>We're just going to have to wait
for their verdict here.</i>

1334
01:44:38,075 --> 01:44:39,739
Let's get you out of there, buddy.

1335
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:41,899
I'm sorry, Teddy. I'm sorry.
I thought I could make up the ground.

1336
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,059
Sorry? What are you talking about?
You did it.

1337
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:46,899
- Did what?
- Jesus. You crazy bastard.

1338
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:50,109
You came third. You got the points.
You're champion of the world!

1339
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:53,863
<i>James Hunt is now officially confirmed</i>

1340
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:56,028
<i>as finishing third here in Japan,</i>

1341
01:44:56,660 --> 01:45:00,379
<i>and that means
he is champion of the world.</i>

1342
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:07,139
<i>Our new World Champion,
James Hunt, by just one single point.</i>

1343
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:13,750
<i>Did we really win?</i>

1344
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:20,061
World bloody Champion!

1345
01:45:28,755 --> 01:45:30,819
Tell us, James,
what are you going to do now?

1346
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:32,982
I shall be getting drunk.

1347
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:36,299
It's wonderful, an absolute dream...

1348
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:51,064
Are you okay?

1349
01:45:53,177 --> 01:45:54,767
Fine.

1350
01:45:56,387 --> 01:45:58,137
No regrets.

1351
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:03,227
Not one.

1352
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:25,299
<i>And our special guest,</i>

1353
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:27,143
<i>Formula 1 champion James Hunt.</i>

1354
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:52,622
Wait. Come on.

1355
01:46:55,780 --> 01:46:57,339
<i>There's no better motor oil</i>

1356
01:46:57,340 --> 01:46:58,944
<i>than Havoline.</i>

1357
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:11,459
Yes, me, too.
Where are we going?

1358
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:12,994
Anywhere I want to go.

1359
01:47:12,995 --> 01:47:15,339
And I don't have to hijack it, either.

1360
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:17,059
As long as I pay for it.

1361
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:19,381
I'm starving.
Let's get some food.

1362
01:47:30,195 --> 01:47:32,299
- Where are we going?
- You lot go ahead.

1363
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:34,268
I won't be a minute.

1364
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:41,784
Good to see you.

1365
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:48,577
I heard you were spending
more and more time in one of these.

1366
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:50,628
Do you fly?
No.

1367
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:52,570
I don't think they'd insure me.

1368
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:54,617
You should try.
It's good for discipline.

1369
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:57,217
You have to stay within the rules,
stick to regulations,

1370
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,871
suppress the ego.
It helps with the racing.

1371
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:03,019
And there I was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical

1372
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:04,624
about the romance of flight.

1373
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:06,550
No, that's all bullshit.

1374
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:09,145
So, what brings you here?

1375
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:12,859
A friend's wedding.
At least I think it was a wedding.

1376
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:15,779
Might have been a birthday or something.
It's all a bit of a blur.

1377
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,099
How about you? Have you been at Fiorano?

1378
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,261
Pre-season testing.

1379
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,379
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1380
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:22,619
I'm not sure that was meant
as a compliment.

1381
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:24,939
When do you start testing? Next week?

1382
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:26,979
No. What, are you nuts?

1383
01:48:26,980 --> 01:48:28,779
I didn't just win
the biggest thing of my life

1384
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:30,480
so I could get right back to work.

1385
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:34,225
Why? You have to.

1386
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:37,979
To prove to all the people who will
always say you just won it because...

1387
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:41,382
Because of what?
Because of your accident?

1388
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:45,000
Niki, is that other people,
or is that you?

1389
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:48,739
I won, okay? On the all-important day,
when it came down to it,

1390
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:51,659
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1391
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,899
And I put my life on the line,
and I saw it through.

1392
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:55,948
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1393
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:58,142
The risks were totally unacceptable.

1394
01:48:58,660 --> 01:49:01,140
You were prepared to die.
To me, that's losing.

1395
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:02,899
Yes, I was. I admit it.

1396
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:05,779
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1397
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:08,777
And that's the effect you have on me.
You'd pushed me that far.

1398
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:10,271
And it felt great.

1399
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:13,579
I mean, hell,
isn't that what we're in this for?

1400
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:16,948
To stare death in the face
and to cheat it?

1401
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:21,100
Come on, there's nobility in that.
It's... It's like being knights.

1402
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:23,864
You English, you're such assholes.

1403
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:26,265
You know my position.

1404
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:28,019
Twenty per cent risk.

1405
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:31,819
No, no, no, Niki, don't bring the
percentages into this. Don't be a pro.

1406
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:34,570
The minute you do that,
you kill what's good about this.

1407
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:36,544
You kill the sport.

1408
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:41,310
James!

1409
01:49:41,620 --> 01:49:43,463
- James!
- Come on!

1410
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:47,825
I've got to go.

1411
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:51,308
Careful in this thing.

1412
01:49:52,340 --> 01:49:53,830
James.

1413
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:02,826
You know, in hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

1414
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:06,064
Pumping the shit out of my lungs.
It was hell.

1415
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:09,390
And while doing it,
I was watching television.

1416
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:12,499
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1417
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:15,050
"That bastard Hunt," I would say.
"I hate that guy."

1418
01:50:15,260 --> 01:50:17,419
And then one day the doctor came and said,

1419
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:19,707
"Mr Lauda,
may I offer a piece of advice?"

1420
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:23,579
"Stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life."

1421
01:50:23,580 --> 01:50:25,819
"It can be a blessing, too."

1422
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:29,137
"A wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends."

1423
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:31,507
And you know what? He was right.

1424
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:37,899
Look at us. We were both
a pair of kids when we met.

1425
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,739
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1426
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:41,583
Disowned by our families.

1427
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:43,065
Headed nowhere.

1428
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:46,539
And now we're both champions of the world.

1429
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:47,951
It was not bad, huh?

1430
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:51,019
No, it's not bad.

1431
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:54,581
So, don't let me down now.
I need you busting my balls.

1432
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,785
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1433
01:50:58,540 --> 01:51:00,588
But I intend to enjoy myself first.

1434
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:03,261
Some of life needs to be for pleasure.

1435
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:06,779
What's the point of having
a million cups and medals and planes

1436
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:08,942
if you don't have any fun?

1437
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:11,469
How is that winning?

1438
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:15,271
- James!
- We're gonna leave without you!

1439
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:17,225
James!

1440
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:22,660
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1441
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:26,382
You will... champ.

1442
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:30,664
You look good, Niki.

1443
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:34,420
The only guy to have his face burnt off
and it be an improvement.

1444
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:43,059
<i>Of course, he didn't listen to me.</i>

1445
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:44,579
<i>For James,</i>

1446
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:46,779
<i>one world title was enough.</i>

1447
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:48,299
<i>He had proved</i>

1448
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:51,659
<i>what he needed to prove, to himself</i>

1449
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:53,947
<i>and anyone who doubted him.</i>

1450
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:56,669
<i>And two years later he retired.</i>

1451
01:51:56,940 --> 01:52:00,581
<i>When I saw him next in London
seven years later,</i>

1452
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:02,828
<i>me as champion again,</i>

1453
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:04,899
<i>him as broadcaster,</i>

1454
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:09,303
<i>he was barefoot
on a bicycle with a flat tyre.</i>

1455
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:12,264
<i>Still living each day like his last.</i>

1456
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:15,510
<i>When I heard he'd died,</i>

1457
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:17,987
<i>aged 45, of a heart attack,</i>

1458
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:19,625
<i>I wasn't surprised.</i>

1459
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:22,509
<i>I was just sad.</i>

1460
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:25,779
<i>People always think of us as rivals,</i>

1461
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:29,387
<i>but he was among the very few I liked,</i>

1462
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:33,670
<i>and even fewer that I respected.</i>

1463
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:39,551
<i>He remains the only person I envied.</i>

1464
01:52:54,184 --> 01:53:01,191

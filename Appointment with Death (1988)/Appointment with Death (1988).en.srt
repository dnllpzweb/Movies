1
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,056
- Did you get soaked, Ginny?
- Begin, mr cope.

2
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,408
- Of course I didn't.
- Very well.

3
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,482
Don't worry about me.

4
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:06,191
In this will your late husband left you
a life interest in his entire estate.

5
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:11,280
After your death it is to be
distributed equally among the children.

6
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,450
As you know, Elmer relied upon you
to look after them.

7
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:19,037
No more than my duty
when I became their stepmother.

8
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,499
However, mrs boynton,
there is a second will.

9
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,459
Second will?

10
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,212
Signed two days before he died.

11
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,633
This is the last will and testament
of Elmer d. Boynton...

12
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,719
Of milk house, spiddletown, New Jersey...

13
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,471
Just the meat and potatoes, mr cope.

14
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,058
The estate is to be divided equally.

15
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,896
You and the children
receiving approximately...

16
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,566
$200,000 each.

17
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,444
I don't believe it.

18
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,196
Bring that here. I want
to see that for myself.

19
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:58,535
Elmer knew the children were not fit
to take control of their own affairs.

20
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,537
He must have changed his mind.

21
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,915
Elmer changed his mind
only under my direction.

22
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,119
It's perfectly valid, mrs boynton.

23
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,341
Shall we read the will?

24
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,803
Have you ever done a discreditable act,
mr cope?

25
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,932
Not professionally, I hope.

26
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:25,395
The affair of the Bolivian silver-mining
corporation slipped your memory?

27
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm not sure what you're...

28
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,233
It used to be called
share pushing, mr cope.

29
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,904
If it were to come to the attention
of the United States law society,

30
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:38,659
you'd be instantly disbarred
and probably go to prison as well.

31
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,494
How did you know about that?

32
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:45,165
I did not serve in the prison
service 14 years for nothing.

33
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,253
People trusted me with
their little secrets.

34
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,675
Your partner, for example.

35
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,595
She went inside, didn't she?

36
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,518
She told me all about you,
and I can prove it.

37
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,940
Well, mrs boynton, I was...
I was young, ambitious.

38
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,943
This room has gotten a little chilly.

39
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,571
Why not get a nice cheerful Blaze going?

40
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,707
Go ahead.

41
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,255
A wise decision, mr cope.

42
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,632
Now we'll call the others.

43
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,601
Bring in the children.

44
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,063
“My dearest children, Lennox,

45
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,732
“Carol,

46
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,191
"Raymond,

47
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,901
“and ginevra.

48
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,447
“I leave in the good and loving hands
of Emily boynton.

49
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:04,411
“And to my wife, Emily boynton,
I leave a life interest in my estate.

50
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,457
“On her death I leave it shared equally

51
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,668
“among my aforementioned
and beloved children.“

52
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,129
- no!
- Jesus Christ! What...

53
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,881
Impossible!

54
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,549
I don't believe it!

55
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,095
And now, children, I
have a lovely surprise.

56
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,139
Another one, stepmother?

57
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,894
My three stepchildren, whom I love
as I do my own daughter ginevra

58
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,231
and you, Nadine, my dear daughter-in-law.

59
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,652
I've arranged for us all to go
to Europe and the holy land.

60
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,280
It will clear the air of death.

61
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,492
- Does that include mr cope?
- Certainly not.

62
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,994
Mr cope has work to do here.

63
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,380
Smile.

64
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,591
Attagirl!

65
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,676
Come on.

66
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,474
Like that.

67
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,647
That's pretty.

68
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,708
Oh, my.

69
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,126
Just as I thought.

70
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,315
That will look great.

71
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,939
Nadine, please, my medicine.

72
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,691
Quickly, please.

73
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,817
Yes, mother.

74
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,488
Someone should be with mother.

75
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,615
I'd like to push her over.

76
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,161
You really think there was another will?

77
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,788
I know there is. Father told me.

78
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:03,251
Daddy said
I was to have $200,000 all to myself.

79
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,544
You see?

80
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,119
What's the point of knowing about it
if we can't do anything about it?

81
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,135
Oh, my dear...

82
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,512
She's all right. Some
girl's gone to help her.

83
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,680
So I see.

84
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,225
Can I help you? I am a doctor, well, just.

85
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,728
Just?

86
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,106
Nadine, over here quickly.

87
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,944
When I get back
I'm going to have it out with cope.

88
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,236
You can do it now.

89
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,406
- Don't be silly, Ginny.
- Look, he's here over by the car.

90
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,991
Let me see.

91
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,120
She's right. He's there.

92
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,877
Cope's here, mother. Did you ask him?

93
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:50,507
Of course he's not here. Here, give
a lira to that girl for her help.

94
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,219
- He's not really here, is he?
- Sure he is, by the terrace café.

95
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,557
Nadine, where are you going?

96
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,940
Excuse me.
My mother asked me to give you this.

97
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,611
I can afford to buy my own cup of coffee,
thank you.

98
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,365
I helped your mother because I'm a doctor.

99
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,574
You are?

100
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,618
Yes, I've just graduated.

101
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,329
I'm sure you did.

102
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,623
Excuse me.

103
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,177
What is the point in authorising a guide,

104
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,847
if, as you say, miss Quinton,
he gets his facts wrong?

105
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,475
It's easy to make a mistake
about dates, lady westholme.

106
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:47,438
Confusing romanesque and gothic
is not a mistake. It is ignorance.

107
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,816
What's the matter, miss Quinton?

108
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,360
I seem to have lost my cigarette case.

109
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,030
That man masquerading as a guide
probably stole it.

110
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,699
Where is he?

111
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,577
Officer.

112
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,413
I want that man arrested.

113
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,833
I am lady westholme,
a member of the British "parliamentos".

114
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,752
That man there is a thief.
You must arrest him.

115
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,764
Officer, I told you. You must arrest him.

116
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,342
Oh, dear.

117
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,026
- I told you not to come.
- I had to.

118
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:43,119
My husband tells me there's another will.
Is that so, Jefferson?

119
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,248
Nadine, darling, I'm your mother's
attorney. I can't divulge that.

120
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:50,210
You think if there's no money for him, I'll
be forced to leave Lennox and come with you.

121
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,878
I think you'll come anyway.

122
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,978
Well, now what if Lennox sees that?
When can I use it with that inscription?

123
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,231
Whenever you want.

124
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,442
You want him to find out, don't you?

125
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,533
Mademoiselle.

126
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,744
Poirot.

127
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,413
- Hercule poirot.
- Yes.

128
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,706
Thank you.

129
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,375
What are you doing in trieste?

130
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,630
I'm taking a well-earned vacation,
miss king. Or is it already doctor?

131
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,715
It's doctor. I graduated with honours.

132
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,759
Probably passed it on to an accomplice
by now.

133
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,302
Oh, dear.

134
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,807
I have heard you enough
for the rest of my life.

135
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,102
Lady westholme is always arguing
with somebody.

136
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,313
Lady westholme?
But she sounds American.

137
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,316
Well, her name was Laura vansittart.

138
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,736
She met lord westholme on a boat trip
back from america.

139
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,365
You know, within a month they were married

140
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,493
and 10 years later
she's a member of our parliament.

141
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,579
Which shows the danger of ocean travel.

142
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,208
This will be good fun.

143
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,961
Go away, ray.

144
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,796
Look who I found.

145
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,965
Get up with me, Nadine.

146
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:24,637
Lennox, you take ray and Carol and walk.
We're going back to the ship.

147
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,222
Yes, mother.

148
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,975
Lennox.

149
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,813
Good morning, Emily.
I decided to join you.

150
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,817
You should be in america, Jefferson,
sorting out the family's affairs.

151
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,945
Yes, well,
I thought I might sort affairs out here.

152
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,697
Driver. To the port.

153
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,002
You know that young man?

154
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,130
His mother nearly became my first client.

155
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,591
Look here. I've found it.

156
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,388
I've got a deep and awful fear that those
ladies are going to be on the ship with us.

157
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,401
Lennox, Nadine, come along.

158
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,779
Mrs boynton.

159
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,199
What have you got there? It's a duck.

160
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,493
Oh, god. It's a dead duck.

161
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,120
Good evening.

162
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,750
Miss Quinton, I thought we'd lost you.

163
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,588
- A friend of mine from england.
- No, thank you.

164
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,991
- May I have some barley water?
- Seems a very nice person.

165
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,468
Miss Quinton has to be careful.

166
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,097
She is to take charge
of the excavations at qumran.

167
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,935
Hercule poirot?

168
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,270
The Belgian?

169
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,149
He's missing an excellent meursault.

170
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,164
Ray, will you dance with me?

171
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,542
You're tired, ginevra. Better go to bed.

172
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,961
I'm not tired, mother. Come on, ray.

173
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,464
- It's 9:00. You go to bed, young lady.
- I won't.

174
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,858
Come on, Ginny. I'll go with you.

175
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,970
Sit down, Nadine.
The child prefers to go by herself.

176
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,225
Yes, I'd rather go alone.
Thank you, Nadine.

177
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,823
Mrs boynton, would you care to dance?

178
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,785
You don't mind, do you, Lennox,
if I take your wife for a spin?

179
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,874
- He's very daring.
- I'll say. He's got a lot of nerve.

180
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,710
You may call me Nadine if you like.

181
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,420
Okey-dokey, Nadine.

182
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:08,342
When we get to Jaffa
why don't we just disappear...

183
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,094
You and me together?

184
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,264
Why, mr cope, the things you do say.

185
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,702
Young man, look through here.
And this is how you get it to focus.

186
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,623
You understand? You move this.
But not until I tell you.

187
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,375
Ready?

188
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,254
One, two, three.

189
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,548
You took it too soon.

190
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,720
- This is charming.
- Yes, indeed.

191
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:53,971
Have a good time.

192
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,522
- Sarwazi swizzle.
- Si, signore.

193
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,150
Hello.

194
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,573
- We met in trieste.
- Yes. You're from england?

195
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:17,453
We went there. It rained.

196
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,622
It often does.

197
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,666
What's that?

198
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,384
When we get to Jaffa,
let's just disappear.

199
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,553
What do we use for money?

200
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,431
I'm not trained for anything.
You're not even a qualified nurse.

201
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,267
It'd be hopeless.

202
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,395
Not as hopeless as
living with your mother.

203
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,355
She can't live forever.

204
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,482
She'll live.

205
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,948
Good morning, monsieur poirot.
How are you feeling today?

206
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,577
You're going to administer
the last rites, doctor?

207
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,829
I have some hyoscine syrup.

208
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,540
Here, two drops will cure you.

209
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,673
Four drops will kill me,
so count them carefully in that case.

210
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,220
Don't mess with me, Jefferson.

211
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,059
You're having an affair
with a married woman,

212
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,102
who happens to be my daughter-in-law.

213
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:28,316
When we get to Jaffa, I suggest you
leave us and go back to america.

214
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,695
They know about the will, Emily.

215
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,533
Elmer told Lennox, and he told ginevra.

216
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:42,622
Why don't you give them some money? Let
them enjoy it while they're still young?

217
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,791
I spent 14 years in prison, Jefferson.

218
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,628
As a matron.

219
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,713
It was still prison.

220
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,341
I'm used to prison.

221
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,468
You're not.

222
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,139
Elmer never made a second will.
Do you understand? Never.

223
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,600
Stay away from my family.

224
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,480
I've done things in my life
that I'm not proud of, Emily.

225
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:13,903
Right now, I must tell you,
it surprises even me.

226
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,906
I'm ready to do something decent.

227
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,785
I want those children of yours
to have a chance.

228
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,997
You may be right.

229
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,796
I'm sorry that I threatened you, but...

230
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,174
Join us tonight for dinner, will you?

231
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,425
Well...

232
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,179
One way or another
you're one of the family after all.

233
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,763
That's terribly nice of you, Emily.

234
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,687
- It'll all work out.
- I'm sure it will.

235
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,814
Now just let me get some rest.

236
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,571
See you at dinner.

237
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,141
She fixed the will. We're trapped.

238
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,437
You do see, don't you?
She's got to be killed.

239
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,897
She's not even our mother.

240
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,986
Look what she's doing to us now.

241
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,491
She treats us like we're puppy dogs.

242
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,618
Exactly. Can you think of any other way?

243
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:15,775
Monsieur poirot, at last you surface
to join us at the captain's table.

244
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,652
Look at them. So garish.

245
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,323
I am sometimes ashamed
of my fellow countrymen.

246
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,242
Yes, but you are British now,
lady westholme.

247
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,913
In fact you are a member of parliament.
Is that not unique?

248
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,916
I've been British for 10 years, monsieur.

249
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,170
I consider myself merely a colonial
who returned to the fold.

250
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,671
Oh, my dear.

251
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,428
A Magnum of Louis roederer cristal, 1928.

252
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,808
To celebrate our last night on the ship.

253
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,185
Lennox, darling,
I must have left my watch in the cabin.

254
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,746
Be a dear and get it for me, would you?

255
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,938
Of course.

256
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,273
Nadine, how careless of you.

257
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,944
Cope's coming.

258
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,404
- Mother asked him.
- She did?

259
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,656
Good evening, everyone.

260
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,033
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Jefferson.

261
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,495
Ravishing.

262
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,996
Excehent

263
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,666
no, no, no! Let me.

264
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,294
It's lucky to pour your own wine.
Your glass, Carol.

265
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,130
Hi. Do you loop-de-ia?

266
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,340
Loop-de-ia?

267
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,925
Jitterbug?

268
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,762
I nearly tried that once.
I think I fell over.

269
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,389
Jefferson, your glass.

270
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,598
Fell over?

271
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,685
Well, doesn't everyone?
It's such a strange dance.

272
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,147
Well, listen, some of
the guys in the band,

273
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,609
you know, when the old fogies
have gone to bed,

274
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,153
they really start to boogie.

275
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,198
Here, around midnight, would you?

276
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,618
I'd be most interested in
boogying with you, mr boynton.

277
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,744
Great.

278
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,121
Jefferson.

279
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,331
Thank you.

280
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,458
See you later.

281
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,838
Ray, your glass.

282
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,548
Careful, it's very full.

283
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,009
- There you are, my dear.
- Thank you.

284
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,261
Do you think we'll get much time?

285
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,846
Lennox not back?

286
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,140
- He won't be a minute.
- Never mind.

287
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,474
Get up.

288
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:19,732
To us all, the family and our dear lawyer.

289
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,526
Health and happiness.

290
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,537
You bastard!

291
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,792
I knew no good would come
from him being here.

292
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,505
Good god!

293
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,342
He's such a nice young man usually.

294
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,594
Oh, no.

295
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:53,557
“To my dearest Nadine,
may we always be together.“

296
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:57,207
Lennox shouldn't have hit him.
It's no way for a gentleman to behave.

297
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,730
It was just a figure of speech.

298
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,736
Get him... get him away from me.

299
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,820
Off.

300
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,660
All right, let's settle it down.
Take it easy.

301
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,828
Did you see him? He's a mad man.

302
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,166
These Americans, scandalous behaviour.

303
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,835
What next, I wonder?

304
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,922
Next, madam, we arrive in the holy land.

305
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,033
Come along, dr king.
I've arranged a little priority for us.

306
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,703
- Priority?
- Baksheesh is the word.

307
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,539
Poirot.

308
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,459
Poirot, good to see you, old fellow.

309
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,838
Yes, colonel carbury.
May I present dr king?

310
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,466
This is colonel carbury.
He's an old friend of mine

311
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,971
and he is responsible
for keeping the peace in this holy land.

312
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,056
Colonel.

313
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,267
Colonel, are you here to meet me?

314
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:22,021
I am lady westholme,
a member of his majesty's government.

315
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:27,276
Your ladyship, the governor's representative,
mr bickerstaff, is over there.

316
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,531
- Where have you been?
- Good morning, lady westholme.

317
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,075
Are you staying at the American colony,
miss king?

318
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,954
- We are on the same tour.
- Well, let me take you there.

319
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,163
Thank you.

320
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,123
Poirot and I are old friends.

321
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:45,252
We were together in India.
In Burma, I believe it was.

322
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,361
What on earth has brought you out here,
old chap?

323
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,800
Oh, I don't know.
A nose for murder, perhaps.

324
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,053
Murder? Where?

325
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,430
Oh, no, it hasn't happened yet.

326
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:01,226
I hope it doesn't happen.
Quite enough to keep us busy here already.

327
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,687
This vehicle is disgusting.

328
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,192
We have you down for six days
in Jerusalem, mr cope,

329
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,819
and then qumran for another four.

330
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,364
Qumran is particularly interesting.
It's on the dead sea.

331
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,532
Excuse me.

332
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,867
I'll wait for you here, sir.

333
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,494
Miss Quinton, isn't it?

334
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,126
Oh, you were the young man who was
involved in the incident last night.

335
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,089
How nice of you to call me young.
Where are you going in Palestine?

336
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:35,385
To qumran. I'm an archaeologist.
I love digging.

337
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,846
I'm a lawyer. I like digging, too.

338
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,937
- How long have you been an archaeologist?
- About 10 years.

339
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,065
I'll deal with this, Nadine. Jefferson.

340
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,442
Would you excuse me?

341
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:57,074
I think it best, Jefferson, if you
distanced yourself from us for a while.

342
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:02,329
As a matter of fact, Emily, I have only
just made arrangements to forego Jerusalem.

343
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,666
I will be going directly to qumran to dig.

344
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,337
Digging too much can be dangerous.

345
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,888
Jerusalem was the capital
of judea and samaria.

346
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,100
The Jewish people had a state here
in biblical times.

347
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,186
Yes, now they flock in
from every country in Europe.

348
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,981
Makes a lot of trouble
for us, I can tell you.

349
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:32,776
Well, I thought that man, weizmann,
put it rather well the other day,

350
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,320
before lord peel's commission
here in Jerusalem.

351
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,282
“There are six million Jews in Europe,"
he said,

352
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,368
“for whom the world is divided
into two parts.

353
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:45,956
“Places in which they are not allowed
to live and places they cannot enter.“

354
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,375
it will have to be solved.

355
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,298
Do you want to go out tonight, poirot?

356
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:59,052
Give me one good night on terra firma.
I'll do anything you want tomorrow.

357
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:02,514
- Well, let me see you in then.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

358
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,360
Isn't that the girl from the ship?

359
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,919
Smile.

360
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,925
Lennox, if daddy had intended to leave me
a lot of money...

361
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,344
Wouldn't he have told mr cope about it?

362
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,889
And why did mr cope disappear?
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

363
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,144
They turned me out
because I have on a sleeveless dress.

364
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,190
Apparently, the almighty
doesn't like my arms,

365
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,192
in spite of having made them.

366
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,528
Sleeves are holy.

367
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,623
So picturesque. I just love it.

368
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,417
Young man, press that. Not yet.

369
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,509
Lady westholme.

370
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,638
This is the men's section.
You are not allowed.

371
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,059
Press the button. Press the button.

372
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:35,023
This is the back of the
holy sepulchre church, you understand.

373
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,608
Mind the steps.

374
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,820
Wait now. Don't all rush.

375
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,448
Raymond, come here!

376
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,326
Is all well, madame?

377
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,080
What are my sufferings
compared to those of our redeemer?

378
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:54,167
Of course. I thought
since my friend there is a doctor.

379
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,504
Hi, can I see you tonight after dinner?

380
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,923
Oh, I...

381
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:04,219
The café El arish.
It's in the square behind the hotel.

382
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,721
- Right.
- Raymond.

383
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,019
Now where are Nadine and Lennox?

384
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,313
Smile.

385
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,150
Come on. You're not still sulking
over Jefferson, are you?

386
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,322
It's a good one.

387
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,661
I love you, Lennox. You know that.
I want our marriage to work.

388
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,497
Nadine! Lennox!

389
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,293
But it won't unless we can get away
from your mother.

390
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,878
Come here!

391
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:47,596
We have so much to see.
Goodbye, monsieur poirot.

392
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:48,930
Goodbye, madame.

393
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,140
Come along, children.

394
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,685
- Mother, can I go swimming?
- Swimming is dangerous, ginevra.

395
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,896
May we go to the dead sea?
I hear it's full of salt.

396
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,940
The proud mother hen with her chicks.

397
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,817
She's a monster.

398
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,363
Are you getting emotionally involved,
dear doctor?

399
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,115
Come.

400
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,103
Dr king.

401
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,607
Hi, I'm Carol boynton.
I have a message for you from Raymond.

402
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,068
I had a feeling he might not turn up.

403
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:48,365
He wanted to, but he wasn't feeling well.
My stepmother went on at him.

404
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,158
About me?

405
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,539
Before her marriage,
our stepmother was a wardress in a prison.

406
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,834
My father was the governor,
and he married her.

407
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,962
And she's still a wardress to us.

408
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,588
How old are you?

409
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,800
Twenty-two. Ray's a year older than I am.

410
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,052
Why don't you leave home?

411
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,805
We wouldn't know where to go
or what to do.

412
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,599
No one outside can really understand.

413
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,187
I think I understand quite well.

414
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:26,027
Please, ray is very sorry.
He really would like to meet you.

415
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:40,250
You're back early, dr king. Why don't you
join colonel carbury and myself?

416
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,169
- I could do with a drink, thank you.
- Yes.

417
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:45,088
Sit down here. I'll order for you.
What would you like?

418
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,225
This is an awful lot of money.
You'd better do the job properly.

419
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,395
Are you sure this is the normal fee
for the work?

420
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,923
I thought you ought to see this, sir.

421
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,411
Oh, lord!

422
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,954
Something serious?

423
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,624
Some American's disappeared from qumran.

424
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,376
Qumran? Isn't that by the dead sea?

425
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,588
This American, do we have anything on him?

426
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,299
His name is

427
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,134
Jefferson cope.

428
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,303
How on earth did you know that?

429
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,056
Ascribe it to the little grey cells.

430
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,560
I have some slight
knowledge of the fellow.

431
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,188
Perhaps I could help?

432
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,398
Would you?

433
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,317
Will you be going out today, sir?

434
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,634
- Good morning, hercule.
- Bonjour, docteur.

435
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:01,289
Mother, please. I'm not a child anymore.

436
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,500
That voice.

437
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,671
Go upstairs, ray, darling, and get my
digitalis. I don't feel very well.

438
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,424
Will you be going out, then?

439
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,394
Mrs boynton,

440
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,981
you have tried to prevent your son
and daughter from making friends with me.

441
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,109
Well, it's just pathetic
and rather ludicrous.

442
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,238
Why be an ogre?
You could be kind if you tried.

443
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,867
I never forget. Remember that.

444
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,536
I never forget anything,

445
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,623
not an action,

446
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,834
not a name,

447
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,168
not a face.

448
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,591
Dr king.

449
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,136
I believe you, too, are going
by car to qumran?

450
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,220
Yes.

451
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,595
I've already complained
about the first one our tour company sent.

452
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,184
I am insisting on decent transport.

453
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,522
Perhaps you will accord me
the pleasure of coming to qumran with me?

454
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,817
Colonel carbury has placed
a car at my disposal.

455
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:15,155
Monsieur poirot, did I hear you say
you had a car available?

456
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,741
I shall be going with monsieur poirot.

457
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,827
- Be sure I get a complete rebate.
- I'll do my very best for you, madam.

458
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,537
A most gracious gesture.

459
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,833
I think so, yes. All
right, let's go to qumran.

460
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:38,345
I'm so looking forward to this.
The desert, the sand, local animals.

461
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,097
I do hope I've brought enough film
for my camera.

462
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,516
I have so much I want to record.

463
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,441
Thank you. I'm hercule poirot.

464
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,109
The hercule poirot?

465
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,445
- My name's healey, sir.
- Oh, yes.

466
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,863
We work along the same lines,

467
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:01,146
putting together a case from little scraps
of evidence that don't seem to make sense.

468
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,037
And what news of mr cope?

469
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,039
Not a thing, I'm afraid.

470
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,626
And there's more bad news.
Miss Quinton has vanished, too.

471
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,503
Miss Quinton and mr cope?

472
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,381
I can't believe it.

473
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,926
What are those people doing?

474
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:21,596
Why, they're digging, mrs lady westholme.

475
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,892
Why are they digging when they should be
searching for miss Quinton?

476
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,519
Sarah king.

477
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,897
Here. Here. Here.
I wish you all would please listen to me.

478
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,691
We have a lady missing.

479
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,902
- There's so much coming and going.
- I want you to stop your digging now.

480
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,406
Visitors and archaeologists
and other excavations.

481
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,659
It was only today we realised
that miss Quinton had gone.

482
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,538
She's very small, very petite.
Why don't you all pay attention?

483
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,499
- Did they both go together?
- Well...

484
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,374
Hello, lady. Look, I found something.
For the cigarette.

485
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,798
And what do you think of that?

486
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,134
Think of what, madame? What is it?

487
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,970
Miss Quinton's cigarette case.

488
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,597
She's always losing it.

489
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,267
It is a vital clue to her whereabouts.

490
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,769
What is that?

491
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,189
Horsemen. Quite a lot of them.

492
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,316
Well, maybe it's their abductors.

493
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:18,862
I think the truth
is probably more prosaic than that.

494
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:23,032
It usually is you know, dr king,
despite appearances.

495
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,495
Goodness me, there she is.

496
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,457
How immensely theatrical.

497
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,627
I hoped to see something like this.

498
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,755
Remind me not to do this again.

499
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,551
Miss Quinton, you've caused much anxiety.

500
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,346
Oh, really? Oh, dear.
Well, we were only in the next valley.

501
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,391
- You were?
- We enjoyed an arabian night in the desert.

502
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,976
It was great fun.

503
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,811
I can imagine it was.

504
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,815
Shucran. Thank you very much.
See you again, I hope.

505
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,445
Well, we rejoice that the lambs
that were lost have returned to the fold.

506
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:05,533
Now that that has been established,
could we have some lunch, mr healey?

507
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,870
That's the most sensible thing
you've said all morning.

508
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,835
There's no need for that noise, madam.
This is not New York.

509
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,046
It is a site of history.

510
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,595
Why, that woman is of the commonest type,
gross and offensive.

511
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,890
Lunch is served a little
further up the hill.

512
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,351
Look at that.

513
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,103
The arabs have a nose
for who tips the most.

514
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,025
Afternoon.

515
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,326
I've been thinking about you.

516
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,623
I know it seems odd
after such a short acquaintance,

517
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,834
but I think I'm in love with you.

518
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,298
Well, if you are, you'd better learn
to stand up for yourself a little.

519
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,677
Behave like a man. Don't you think?

520
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:12,058
It's never as true as it is about food
in this region.

521
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,019
It looks like lamb.

522
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:21,234
A very nice meal, wasn't it, children?
Considering it was prepared by foreigners.

523
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:23,945
Poirot!

524
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,657
- Is that...
- Poirot!

525
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,788
Since there is no mystery for me to solve,

526
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:38,376
colonel carbury has persuaded me
to visit the town of acre with him.

527
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,088
Well, I shall just have to manage
without you, monsieur poirot.

528
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,299
You will do it all too well.

529
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,886
Small ones in the front,
tall ones in the back. That's it.

530
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:51,681
I'm coming, carbury. Excuse me.
I must hurry.

531
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,184
I'm sorry.

532
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,394
I'll bet you are.

533
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,356
Good-bye.

534
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:07,572
I think you should all take a little walk.

535
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,534
It will do you good to get away
from me for a little while.

536
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:11,784
Smile.

537
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,580
- Say "cheese".
- Cheese!

538
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,375
Lennox will settle me
in my chair outside my tent,

539
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,629
and, Nadine, you'll see
that I have my medicine.

540
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:29,677
I don't want to go to bed.
Why should I go to bed? I'm not going to.

541
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,429
Ginevra, go to your tent.

542
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,056
I'm not tired.

543
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,809
- Of course you are, go to rest at once.
- All right.

544
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,311
- Raymond.
- Yes, ma'am.

545
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:43,316
Why don't you ask dr king
if she'd like to join you on your walk?

546
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,486
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

547
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,112
And while you're there,

548
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:52,200
ask lady westholme if she could spare me
a moment while you're all gone.

549
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:58,831
Jefferson, mother suggested
we go for a walk.

550
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,793
You know qumran.
Where do you think we should go?

551
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,378
Well,

552
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,548
back in the hills.

553
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,634
It's quite lovely.

554
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,928
I've been there before.

555
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,892
- I bet you have.
- Would you like me to take you?

556
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,147
- Mother.
- Come now. Let's all be friends.

557
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,235
This is too confined a
spot for tribulation.

558
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:33,241
Excuse me. I was wondering, dr king,
if you'd care to accompany us on our walk?

559
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,493
I should like that very much.

560
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:40,873
I do not believe in exercise after lunch.
I think I'll go to my tent and work.

561
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,128
My stepmother would like
a word with you later, lady westholme.

562
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,379
She would?

563
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,257
Shall we go?

564
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:50,967
So do I.

565
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,844
I thought we were all going for a walk.

566
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:57,127
I have permission to go with miss Quinton.
She's going to explain the diggings to me.

567
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,059
- Well, have fun.
- Thanks.

568
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,661
They've found some bronzes
with very odd markings on them.

569
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,067
All ready? Off you go, then.

570
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,987
I guess it must be very different
from england, miss king.

571
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,197
Of course it's different.

572
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,836
- I've had enough.
- What's up, Lennox?

573
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,212
I'm going down.

574
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,631
Aren't you feeling well?

575
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,508
There he goes.

576
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,233
Well, what's the old saying? You
shouldn't join if you can't take a joke.

577
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,352
Don't you think
we should go down with him?

578
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,282
You said I should behave like a man.

579
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,918
I'm going back now.

580
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,630
No, on my own.

581
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:16,928
There's something I have to say and do
to prove to you that...

582
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,680
You don't have to prove anything
to me, Raymond.

583
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,432
To myself then.

584
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:47,125
- Where is everyone?
- They've gone down below, haven't they?

585
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,503
They've gone to see what was found today
at the digging.

586
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,141
No. No. No, please. Will you please...

587
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,861
Thank you, carbury.

588
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,831
I don't know I'm sure whether
we should partition Palestine or not.

589
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,042
Maybe we should have left it to the Turks.

590
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:34,630
I never studied all that.
I was too busy with my medical curriculum.

591
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,008
It's a pity.

592
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:41,470
You learn so much about a place,
but only if one has prepared.

593
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:45,391
In my view the British...

594
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,310
Excuse me, lady westholme.

595
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,743
- Let me. I'm a doctor.
- She no answer, lady.

596
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:13,127
Let me do it, Ginny. Let me do it.

597
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,587
- Excuse me.
- Let me see.

598
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,340
What does she want?

599
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,344
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

600
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,557
Mr boynton, I'm sorry.
Your stepmother is dead.

601
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,979
- Careful, Margaret.
- You've got to take care of her.

602
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,522
There you are.

603
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,863
It's all right. It's all right.

604
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:54,502
But I just spoke to her an hour ago.
It's not possible.

605
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,572
What, in your opinion,
was the cause of death, dr king?

606
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,285
Heart failure seems the most likely.

607
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,204
And can you estimate a time of death?

608
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,000
Well, I'm not very experienced
at that sort of thing,

609
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:38,629
but I'd say a couple
of hours ago at least.

610
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,964
I see.

611
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:43,718
You noticed the marks
on the wrist, of course?

612
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,637
No, what kind of marks?

613
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,932
Oh, yes, little pin pricks.

614
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:54,437
She had a bad heart condition.
I'm convinced she died of natural causes.

615
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,940
You know, when someone is hated
as much as mrs boynton was,

616
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:03,362
a sudden death by natural causes
seems a little too convenient.

617
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:09,285
Do you think you've stumbled
on another murder, monsieur poirot?

618
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:14,165
Would you oblige me
by opening your medical bag?

619
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:15,958
Yes, of course.

620
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:20,004
Though, I really don't
see what possible...

621
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,180
Someone has been here.

622
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,765
Excuse me.

623
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:35,853
This bottle of digitalis, was it empty?

624
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,274
No, it was full.

625
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:51,994
Really, poirot,

626
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:56,011
are you sure you're not letting your
professional instincts run away with you?

627
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,501
Why should I do that, mon colonel?

628
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,753
Old woman with a heart condition,

629
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,713
- walking, heat.
- Yes.

630
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,800
Yes, I know she had pricks in the arm,
a family that hated her.

631
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,303
She could easily have taken
an overdose of her own medicine.

632
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,764
No, because it was her habit
to take that drug in water

633
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,350
administered by her daughter-in-law.

634
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,227
You mean, she's a suspect?

635
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:19,063
My dear colonel, everybody is a suspect.

636
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,941
Well, you're the expert,
but what do you want me to do?

637
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:27,029
That doctor... what's her name?
Dr king thought it was natural causes.

638
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:32,868
I'm convinced
that mrs boynton was murdered.

639
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,621
Can you show me any evidence?

640
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:39,208
I can do better than that.
I can identify the guilty party.

641
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,627
Oh, my dear fellow,
I couldn't possibly ask you to do that.

642
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,105
I mean, you're on holiday after all.

643
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,131
I give you my word of honour.

644
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:47,467
You mean you'll give us a case
that will stick?

645
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:52,263
I don't know that I can do that,
but I can tell you who the murderer is.

646
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:57,435
Well, how long will it take? I can't keep
all these people here as suspects forever.

647
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,439
They'll soon run out of day trips
to take and insist on going home.

648
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:05,359
I will give you the truth in two days.

649
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,279
Very well. Very well, 48 hours.

650
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,699
In time for the coronation junket
at the American colony.

651
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,617
You seem very certain.

652
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,954
I am very certain because, you see,
people like to talk,

653
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:19,623
and in talking they tell the truth.

654
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:25,212
Why? It puts much less of a strain
on the memory.

655
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,633
Oh, but, of course
you have to have the genius to listen.

656
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,478
Thank you very much.

657
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,937
Dr king.

658
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,859
Very pretty, miss, for you special price.

659
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,319
Twenty dinars.

660
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,154
Offer him five.

661
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,739
But, sir...

662
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,410
Tea time. Come along.

663
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,954
Five dinars. I give in.

664
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,965
You still think someone killed her
with an injection?

665
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:12,635
Someone? You had as good a motive
as anyone.

666
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,516
Well, you called mrs boynton an ogre,
did you not, back at the hotel?

667
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,976
I criticised her behaviour.

668
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,061
And how did she respond to that?

669
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,313
Well, all she said was...

670
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,524
I never forget anything,

671
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,861
not an action,

672
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,155
not a name,

673
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,700
not a face.

674
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,245
Then you fell in love
with Raymond boynton.

675
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:42,228
Of course his stepmother
could never allow such a marriage.

676
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:45,084
In any case he could never
leave home of his own accord.

677
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,546
That's rubbish. He'd already made up
his mind to do exactly that.

678
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,172
You had discussed it with him?

679
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,465
Yes.

680
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,968
Earlier yesterday afternoon?

681
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:55,803
Yes, as a matter of fact.

682
00:50:56,637 --> 00:51:00,266
Dr king, could you tell me exactly
what happened yesterday after lunch,

683
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,059
when I was no longer there?

684
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,686
Well, as you know,

685
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,451
- we were all going off for a walk.
- Yes.

686
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,190
It must've been about 3:15
when we left the camp.

687
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,610
Nadine was flirting
dreadfully with mr cope.

688
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,863
Lennox was sulking,
and then suddenly he said...

689
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,574
I'm going down.

690
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,659
And what time was it?

691
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,869
- About quarter to 4:00.
- And then?

692
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,039
I stayed and talked to Raymond.

693
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:28,252
He said he was going back.
He said he had to prove something.

694
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:32,172
There's something I have to say and do.

695
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,883
It was 5.:00, I'd say.

696
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:38,470
Perhaps he decided
to murder his stepmother.

697
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,765
Raymond's incapable of such a thing.

698
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:46,520
Excuse me, I heard him plot exactly
such a thing with his sister Carol.

699
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:48,939
I heard them by chance, aboard ship.

700
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:54,778
How is it you're always in the right place
to hear threats and plots, monsieur poirot?

701
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,033
Put it down to a gift, if you will.

702
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,328
When did you return to the camp?

703
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,787
About 6:00.

704
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:07,666
I saw mrs boynton. The arab
was having trouble waking her for dinner.

705
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,835
You were arriving then yourself.

706
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:13,213
And you insist that mrs boynton
had been dead for two hours?

707
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,506
I do.

708
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:19,303
In other words, when Raymond came down,
he said he spoke to his stepmother.

709
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:22,556
He must have been speaking to a corpse?

710
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,686
I thought, monsieur
poirot, we were friends.

711
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,938
We were while I was still on holiday,

712
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:33,067
but now I have been empowered
by his majesty's representative

713
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,570
to conduct an inquiry.
All suspects are equal.

714
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,408
And you really believe, monsieur,
that I am a suspect?

715
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:44,328
Why not? It would be very easy
for you to go to your tent.

716
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,955
On the way back
you stop briefly at mrs boynton

717
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:51,293
and you give her her fatal dose.
After all, you're a doctor.

718
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:56,548
And to put the clock back two hours
would protect both you and dear Raymond.

719
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,926
That is the most...

720
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,012
Dr king, I suspect,

721
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:06,183
that your butterfly's on upside down.

722
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,586
Hercule poirot.

723
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,383
Thank you.

724
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,927
It was quite extraordinary really, I...

725
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,262
Enter.

726
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,726
May I present monsieur poirot, lord peel.

727
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:50,185
A distinct honour.

728
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,731
I extended my morning break when I heard
you were coming, monsieur poirot.

729
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,066
Lord peel heads a royal commission.

730
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:00,237
On his judgment alone
rests the fate of Palestine.

731
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,365
A task for Solomon.

732
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,701
The arabs wouldn't think so.

733
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,456
Excuse me, monsieur poirot,
lady westholme, miss Quinton.

734
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,583
Delegations await me.

735
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,210
I hope they're not getting too impatient.

736
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,672
Lady westholme, I badly need your help.

737
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,593
Fire away.
Miss Quinton and I will do our best.

738
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:27,055
When it comes to matters of public duty,
one must be punctilious.

739
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:31,727
As my dear father used to say,
“when the stern call of duty comes“...

740
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,021
What is it you want to know?

741
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,482
Well... no, thank you very much.

742
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:41,111
I'm particularly interested in the period
yesterday after we finished lunch.

743
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:44,698
You did not immediately
go for your walk, I believe.

744
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,825
Knowing I was to meet lord peel today.

745
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,038
I attempted to study my papers
on the history of Palestine.

746
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:54,041
I was asked to have a conversation
with mrs boynton.

747
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,502
- And you went?
- Indeed.

748
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:59,880
Pardon my... what did you talk about?

749
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:01,882
She started to attack me...

750
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,260
Because the British do not want
mrs Simpson to marry their king.

751
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,681
It must be the only subject
on which she and I could possibly agree.

752
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,724
But she would not listen to me.

753
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,309
And then?

754
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,645
Having failed to ruffle my feathers,

755
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,356
she picked an argument
with one of the arabs.

756
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,691
She seemed very annoyed with him.

757
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:23,821
Having servants about who cannot speak
a word of English is very trying.

758
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,656
Could you identify this man?

759
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,909
I couldn't see his face.
I had returned to my tent,

760
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,579
but I can tell you
he was of more than average height.

761
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,289
He wore the usual native headdress.

762
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:38,168
In addition, he had on a pair
of torn and patched breeches

763
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,797
and his puttees were wound most untidily.

764
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,758
And after that you went for your walk?

765
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:49,513
No, I waited for miss Quinton to return
and suggested that we ask mrs boynton

766
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,726
if she wanted anything before we left
the camp. That would've been about...

767
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,103
4:00.

768
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,773
- 4:00.
- 4:00.

769
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:05,279
We're going for a walk, mrs boynton.
Is there anything we can do for you?

770
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,490
She grunted like a pig.

771
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,159
Most offensive.

772
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:16,623
Quite obviously, she drinks.
Come along, miss Quinton.

773
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,418
She's not the sort of person
we should talk to.

774
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,336
And when you came back?

775
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:26,133
We didn't talk to mrs boynton again.
I returned to my work.

776
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:28,719
And I went down to the huts below

777
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,264
to see if anything significant
had been unearthed that day.

778
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:36,685
Telephone for you, lady westholme.
It is lord westholme from england.

779
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,271
- May I?
- Madame.

780
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,030
I hope the line is clearer than it was.

781
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:51,033
A providential phone call.

782
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:55,329
Did you actually see
mrs boynton speak to an arab boy?

783
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,081
I did see someone in white approach her.

784
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:02,586
The sun was in my eyes,
but I thought it might be...

785
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:03,837
It might be?

786
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:08,967
The sheik who brought us back.
But, of course, it wasn't.

787
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:12,387
No. And then?

788
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,848
I went back to Carol boynton.

789
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,644
Well, it's been most informative.
Thank you so much. Yes.

790
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,397
- There was something else.
- Oh?

791
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,484
But I can't remember what it was.

792
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,613
Well, when you think of it,
don't hesitate to tell me.

793
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,408
Oh, mr cope and I are to go to Petra.

794
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:39,039
Petra? The Rose-red city
half as old as time.

795
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,875
Roses. That's it.

796
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,086
Something to do with roses?

797
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:49,132
Roses, greenfly, spray, syringe!

798
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,344
Syfinge?

799
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,388
While I was walking back down,

800
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,598
I saw this little box.

801
00:57:56,765 --> 00:58:01,812
I picked it up, and inside
was one of those hypodermic things.

802
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,940
To whom did it belong?

803
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,651
It was Carol boynton's.

804
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:11,113
She thanked me for finding it
and took it with her

805
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,240
when she went to fetch ginevra.

806
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:19,705
Colonel carbury phoned.
He asked us all to stay in Jerusalem.

807
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,666
Only for a day or two, madame.

808
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:23,875
For what?

809
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:28,714
You can't seriously suggest that I
murdered that ludicrous boynton woman?

810
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,968
I'm terribly sorry, but once my
investigation is under way, it's...

811
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,512
Monsieur poirot,
I'm deeply disappointed in you.

812
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,723
Come along, miss Quinton.

813
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:46,565
I'm so sorry.

814
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,818
The British aristocracy's well-known
for its bad manners.

815
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:53,196
They call it eccentricity.
Oh, I'm quite used to it.

816
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,119
- Bottoms up.
- Cheers.

817
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,251
He's coming over.

818
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,434
Colonel carbury said you wanted to see us.

819
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,881
I'm investigating your
mother-in-law's death.

820
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,550
It doesn't need investigating.
She died quite naturally.

821
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:18,221
I think not. If I might have a few moments
with your husband?

822
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,808
I've a good mind to call our consul.

823
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,102
Oh, that's your right.
I mean, if you object to my...

824
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,645
We don't. I'll wait in the lobby.

825
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,814
Thank you very much.

826
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,742
Well, you have your freedom at last.

827
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:39,993
Freedom?

828
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,330
Well, at least you've managed
to save your marriage.

829
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,667
You go too far, monsieur poirot.
I'll speak of that day.

830
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,461
Tell me about it.

831
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:54,508
When you returned from your walk
that afternoon, you were alone?

832
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,218
That's right.

833
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:59,846
And at what time did you reach the tents?

834
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:04,226
Soon after 4:00. I looked in on Ginny.
She was asleep.

835
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:07,395
And what exactly did you say
to your stepmother?

836
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,314
She said I hadn't been gone very long

837
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,525
and I said how hot it was.

838
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,694
That's all?

839
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,113
No, she...

840
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,199
She asked me what time it was,
since her watch had stopped.

841
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:22,702
I took it off her, wound it up,
and set it to the correct time.

842
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,246
Which was?

843
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,748
Just a quarter after 4:00.

844
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,166
And then?

845
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,752
Then I asked her
if there was anything she wanted.

846
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,296
She said no. She was rather tired.

847
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:38,552
Soon after that I left her to join
Carol and Ginny at the excavations.

848
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:43,849
And she told you of no annoyance
caused by an arab boy?

849
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,350
No. No, she didn't.

850
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,937
No, you saw no one of that
description then. An arab boy?

851
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:52,149
- Not a soul. Except down below, of course.
- Yes, of course.

852
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,693
Well, thank you very much indeed,
mr boynton.

853
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:58,029
If I may have a few moments
of your wife's time.

854
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:07,080
Why do you think mrs boynton
was murdered, monsieur poirot?

855
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,582
Well, from all I've heard

856
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,043
it's difficult to understand
why she wasn't murdered before.

857
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:18,967
I don't regret her death,
but I do feel responsible.

858
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:23,889
My married life has not been
particularly happy, monsieur poirot.

859
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,225
I came to the boynton house, a poor girl

860
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:31,309
hoping to pay for the rest of my nurse's
training by taking care of the old lady.

861
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,940
Then I fell in love with Lennox.

862
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,318
Mrs boynton's condition
for letting us marry

863
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,404
was that we both
continue to stay living with her.

864
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,171
I assumed
that this would only be temporary

865
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:46,244
but I underestimated her hold
on my husband.

866
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,664
So in the end I came to a decision.

867
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,585
When did you come to this decision?

868
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,338
On the afternoon
of my mother-in-law's death.

869
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,924
I have to tell Emily, darling.

870
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:03,220
I decided to leave Lennox
for an old flame, Jefferson cope.

871
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:07,641
Oh, a flame perhaps, but hardly
an old one. What happened?

872
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,520
I returned to the camp
about 10 minutes after Lennox.

873
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,482
About 4:30?

874
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:18,360
I decided to tell her there and then.

875
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,488
Oh, before you told your husband?

876
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,365
How did she react?

877
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,701
She took it very badly.

878
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:30,538
I refused to listen to her insults
and left to join the others.

879
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:34,960
Do you think it was the shock
of your decision which killed her?

880
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,129
But when did you tell your husband?

881
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,133
My husband and I talked down at the huts.

882
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:45,428
Madame, do you by any chance
own a hypodermic syringe?

883
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:50,809
I carry one in my medicine chest,
but I didn't take it to qumran.

884
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:55,272
Mrs boynton was taking
a medicine called digitalis?

885
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,857
I usually gave it to her in water.

886
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,527
And if she had taken an overdose...

887
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:06,157
Well, it would've killed her certainly, but
she was always very careful, and so was I.

888
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:10,287
You don't think there's any chance the
chemist who was making it up might've...

889
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,747
It's highly unlikely, monsieur poirot.

890
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:17,168
Well, I suppose the
analysis will tell us all.

891
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,588
No, unfortunately the bottle containing
her medicine

892
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:23,341
was broken when we brought her back.

893
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,141
I did not kill my mother-in-law,
monsieur poirot.

894
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:35,729
She was alive and well when I left her.
We've all suffered for so long.

895
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:39,941
What good does it do to bring ruin and
misery to the lives of innocent people?

896
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,360
But who are these innocent people?

897
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:47,574
At least one of you is very guilty indeed.
Good day, madame.

898
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:53,830
Don't worry, darling.

899
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,416
- Room 21.
- Certainly, sir.

900
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,336
Mr cope,

901
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,005
I thought that colonel carbury's
representative

902
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,257
asked you not to leave Jerusalem?

903
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,800
Yes, well...

904
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,094
I have colonel carbury on the line.

905
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,805
Perhaps if you do not care
for this accommodation

906
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:14,059
you could move
to British military headquarters?

907
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,270
Rather less comfortable.

908
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:21,191
Take the gentleman's
bags back to his room.

909
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:26,112
No. No, now that your clothes
are on their way back to their cupboard,

910
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,615
perhaps we could take a walk?

911
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,492
There's really nothing I can say.

912
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,870
Come, mr cope.
You've had a most eventful vacation.

913
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,456
First of all, you almost persuade
an attractive young woman

914
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,791
to leave her husband.

915
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,169
Secondly, another young woman
falls for your charms.

916
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:46,091
Thirdly, another one is dead,
not inconveniently for you.

917
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:53,223
I enjoyed a long and rewarding association
with Emily boynton and her husband.

918
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,726
In fact, her death
came as a double blow to me.

919
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,896
The lady I one day hoped to marry

920
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:05,026
as a result of her husband's new
acquisitions of wealth and freedom,

921
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,654
decided to remain with him.

922
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,782
Now what sort of convenience
has this tragedy for me?

923
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:15,829
Mr cope, mrs boynton made you present to
the family a will made out in her favour

924
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:19,708
which was invalidated by another one
made out in favour of the children.

925
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,918
You were about to be discovered.

926
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:25,046
Mrs boynton's death
saved you from scandal.

927
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,715
- Please.
- From disgrace!

928
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:31,803
Rest assured my only interest
is the crime of murder.

929
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:37,350
When did you return to the camp?

930
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,353
I stayed a few more moments with Nadine.

931
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,441
It was obvious that dr king and Raymond
had no desire for company,

932
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,317
so I started back.

933
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:50,738
I guess I must've got back
to the camp at about 5:00.

934
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:55,160
Shortly after that
Carol boynton came up for ginevra.

935
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:58,246
Which gave you plenty of time to go
into dr king's tent,

936
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:02,709
take the hypodermic syringe and put an end
to a long and valued friendship.

937
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:06,671
I've made mistakes in my life,
mr poirot, many of them,

938
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,381
but I am not a murderer.

939
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,508
Allow me to judge that.

940
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:16,264
There are so many possibilities.
I'm totally baffled.

941
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:21,936
Well then, mon Cher colonel, I wish you to
address yourself to the following questions.

942
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:27,692
The time of death. Is dr king
telling the truth? If not, why not?

943
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:33,072
Why did madame boynton
encourage her family to go away?

944
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:38,369
And why was it mahmoud
who tried to wake mrs boynton?

945
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:42,040
Why did not some member of the family
attempt this earlier?

946
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:45,335
- You want me to question mahmoud?
- You know the lingo.

947
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:49,297
And see where he and the other arabs
were at the crucial time?

948
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:53,301
It may have been one of them
who was seen arguing with mrs boynton.

949
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:58,097
Perhaps. I go now to question
the last of our little group.

950
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:02,310
The concierge tells me
that they went sightseeing to bayt jibrin.

951
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,604
Well, I'll report to you at dinner.

952
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,730
What fun!

953
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,815
Fun?

954
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:13,821
Everything is always fun for you English.
The sun will never set on your games.

955
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:18,409
Well, I hope it will always be so.
Although I have my doubts.

956
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,297
What are you doing there, miss?

957
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,677
Hiding from the light of day.

958
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,304
Only the guilty hide.

959
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,431
I'm guilty of nothing, monsieur poirot.

960
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:43,935
Well, suppose you tell us
what happened that afternoon.

961
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,605
After that you can explore
the darkness to your heart's content.

962
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,818
Miss Quinton showed me
the ivories that they had discovered

963
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,528
and then I went up for ginevra.

964
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:54,946
What time did you go up?

965
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,407
About a quarter past 5:00.

966
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:01,077
Did you talk to your stepmother?

967
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:02,996
As a matter of fact I did.

968
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:07,542
She was sitting by her tent, and I said
I was going to get ginevra, and she said:

969
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:11,629
Let her sleep. No time asleep is wasted.

970
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:15,049
It's like money in the
bank, a store of health.

971
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:20,054
I got Ginny, and she was chattering to me
about a sheik visiting her in her tent.

972
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,640
Now, my stepmother was asleep
when we went by,

973
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:26,227
and Ginny kept insisting
that a sheik had come to take her away.

974
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,605
Yes, of course, that is your story,

975
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:32,358
but you could quite easily have taken
your hypodermic syringe,

976
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:35,194
the one miss Quinton found
where you dropped it,

977
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,114
and you could've killed mrs boynton.

978
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,867
I don't know how that got where it did.

979
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,495
Do you really think that I would kill
my own mother?

980
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:46,122
“But she's not even our mother“,

981
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:49,542
you said to your brother Raymond
on the boat

982
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,378
when he was determined
that she should die.

983
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,588
You heard?

984
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,049
I heard every word.

985
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,982
We were mad even to think about it,
but we were desperate.

986
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:03,431
It was intolerable what she was doing
to Ginny and to Nadine and Lennox.

987
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:04,974
And so you killed her.

988
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:07,727
No, we talked about it,
but we didn't do it.

989
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:10,355
In the morning
the whole thing seemed ridiculous,

990
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,399
like one of those dramas
that you dream up in the dark.

991
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,316
I had nothing to do with her death.

992
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,902
You do believe me, don't you, mr poirot?

993
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,531
I've not said that I don't.

994
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:28,206
You can come out now, mr Raymond.

995
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,459
Hello, monsieur poirot.

996
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:38,341
So you overheard our conversation
just as I overheard your conversation.

997
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:43,513
Yeah, but we didn't go ahead with that
stupid plan to kill our stepmother.

998
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:47,225
- Non?
- Definitely non. I was with miss king.

999
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:51,813
And then I went down. There was something
I had to tell my mother.

1000
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:54,482
About dr king and yourself?

1001
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:57,819
Exactly. She was pretty upset.

1002
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:01,948
I forbid you to see her again.
Do you hear me?

1003
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,243
There was no point in arguing,

1004
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:08,788
so I went down below
to look at the artefacts.

1005
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:12,667
At what time did you talk
to your stepmother?

1006
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:14,585
About 5:30.

1007
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,338
5:30, after she was dead. Yes, well...

1008
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:21,342
Dr king says
that she examined the body at 6:00.

1009
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,803
It had been dead for about two hours.

1010
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,097
She's wrong.

1011
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:32,019
Don't you think it is possible
that you took dr king's syringe

1012
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:35,606
and injected
mrs boynton as you had planned?

1013
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:39,318
After all, this would leave you free
to marry dr king,

1014
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:41,404
a rich man.

1015
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,197
Is that what you suspect?

1016
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:44,866
Was your plan any different?

1017
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,410
Oh, yes. That's why I don't understand.

1018
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,954
All right. All right. What was your plan?

1019
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:57,295
I don't think I'm going to say any more.

1020
01:10:58,379 --> 01:10:59,630
Not even to me?

1021
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,386
Right.

1022
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:10,183
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1023
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,652
Monsieur poirot.

1024
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:28,576
Monsieur poirot, come here.

1025
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:39,712
I must see you.

1026
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,217
Well then, come forward, sir or madam,

1027
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,094
and let me see you.

1028
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:56,604
Tomorrow at 10:00.
The back door of the hotel at 10:00.

1029
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:09,617
Thank you, sir.

1030
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,542
Oh, good evening, miss Quinton.

1031
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:15,748
Oh, good evening, mr poirot.
Are your investigations nearly over?

1032
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:20,378
Well, I must say that... oh, that must be
the largest spider I've ever seen.

1033
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,964
Look, it's going back to its hole

1034
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,759
and a brown one at that.
Did you see the spider, miss Quinton?

1035
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,679
Oh, yes. Spiders do not frighten me.

1036
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:34,851
I see so many in the course
of my scrapping and digging. Oh. Bye-bye.

1037
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,187
We really shouldn't talk to him, my dear.

1038
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,942
My dear fellow, I'm sorry
if we're a little late.

1039
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,403
Mr Rogers here
has been writing up the notes

1040
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,489
of the talks we had with the arab boys
at qumran.

1041
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,114
Had any of them seen anything?

1042
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:51,841
They saw everything and nothing.

1043
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:55,705
We will discuss these notes later,
mon colonel.

1044
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,030
- A creme de cassis, s'il vous plait.
- Whisky and soda.

1045
01:12:58,082 --> 01:12:59,083
Certainly, sir.

1046
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,711
You're on duty now, Rogers.
You'd better get back to the office.

1047
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:03,337
One moment, Rogers, please.

1048
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:08,009
Would you be kind enough to ask our
American friends if they have... hello.

1049
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,511
They have any knowledge of that person?

1050
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,723
Leave it to me, sir. My connections are
tiptop. I was in North America.

1051
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,201
- Thank you, Rogers. That'll do. Good night.
- Good night, sir.

1052
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:20,730
Colonel carbury, may I raise my glass to
criminology, the easiest of all sciences.

1053
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,070
- Hello, mr poirot.
- Oh, my dear. How are you?

1054
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,234
- Come on.
- Why can't I talk to him?

1055
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:29,322
One arab, mahmoud's assistant,
I believe he knew something.

1056
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,866
Yes, he's asked to see me in the morning.

1057
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:35,453
He has? Do you know who did it?

1058
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:40,541
I'm fairly certain, but I want one final
meeting between them all tomorrow.

1059
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:44,462
And we must find a really
dramatic location for this encounter.

1060
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:47,882
I don't want it to be too late.
It's the coronation dance, you know.

1061
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,634
I'll need time to change.

1062
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,968
Good evening.

1063
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,264
You used to be so popular.

1064
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,230
This is an outrage.

1065
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:06,400
He commands me to take tea.

1066
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,778
At the Springs of sataf.

1067
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,571
You mean it's a picnic?

1068
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:13,366
You may be a colonel, mr carbury

1069
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:15,952
but I am a fully accredited member

1070
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,538
of his majesty's government.
You trifle with me at your peril

1071
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,040
with these silly charades.

1072
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,834
Murder is not a charade, your ladyship.

1073
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:28,923
If you prefer, I can have monsieur poirot
conduct his interview here.

1074
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,300
One more day I will put up with this.

1075
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,011
After the coronation ball tonight, I go.

1076
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,473
Dr king.

1077
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:39,350
See you at the market.

1078
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,937
I want to apologise for last night.
It was silly ignoring you.

1079
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:46,524
We're all on edge.
You are a formidable inquisitor, you know.

1080
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,109
It will all be over today.

1081
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:50,194
At your theatrical tea party?

1082
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,866
Couldn't you drop it, hercule?

1083
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:59,078
So many of us stand a chance
of happiness now.

1084
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:03,582
Isn't that Hassan from the camp at qumran?

1085
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,669
Yes, indeed.
We have an important meeting arranged.

1086
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:10,339
Hassan, I'm glad you've come. I was...

1087
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:13,175
Hassan, don't go. I'll fetch him back.

1088
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:18,431
Monsieur poirot,
I'm going to the market now.

1089
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,484
Hassan! Come back!

1090
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:16,447
Sorry.

1091
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,729
Single round. Fire!

1092
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,782
You better come with us, miss.

1093
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:46,120
She said she was chasing the boy,
and he ran into this street.

1094
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:50,791
The shot came from the side.
A gun was thrown in to lie beside the boy.

1095
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,585
She ran up to him, picked it up.

1096
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,712
Do you really believe all that?

1097
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,966
Dr king was wearing a thin cotton dress.
She had no handbag.

1098
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:02,928
There was nowhere to hide
even a small revolver like this one.

1099
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:07,933
Our chaps dusted it for fingerprints.
Only dr king's were on it.

1100
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:11,270
Well, the boynton family...

1101
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:15,941
Lady westholme, miss Quinton, mr cope,
all in the area

1102
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:19,361
and all the family vouching for each other
as you'd expect.

1103
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:20,696
What do we do?

1104
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:22,823
Release dr king.

1105
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,121
You are free to go.

1106
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,624
I didn't kill him.

1107
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:35,920
It is now 2:30. There is just time to have
you driven back to your hotel and then...

1108
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:39,298
Surely you're not still performing
your picnic interview?

1109
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:44,261
Oh, yes.
We are foregathering in sataf as arranged

1110
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,305
for afternoon tea.

1111
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,935
Colonel carbury and I
have gone to a great deal of trouble

1112
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:53,938
to arrange this spree,

1113
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:58,567
and I am sure
you will find it informative, refreshing

1114
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:01,487
and even entertaining.

1115
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:03,697
It's like a scene from a play.

1116
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:08,369
Yes, well, if you wish to present a
comedy, you must first set the scene.

1117
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:12,998
And the same is true
even if it turns out to be a tragedy.

1118
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:15,668
Ladies and gentlemen.

1119
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:20,089
A complete waste
of British military resources.

1120
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:24,885
Colonel carbury has done me
the honour of consulting me.

1121
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,264
Why? Why the devil should he bring you
into this business?

1122
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:31,308
I am often brought in
in cases of sudden death.

1123
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:36,563
Mrs boynton's death gave her family
not only financial independence

1124
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:40,025
but also a liberation from a tyranny,

1125
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,778
which had become well nigh insupportable.

1126
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:47,574
Raymond boynton had been overheard

1127
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:51,161
discussing the possibility
of taking mrs boynton's life.

1128
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:54,248
He had fallen in love.

1129
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:59,962
You told me you returned to the camp
at 5:30 and spoke to your stepmother.

1130
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:05,301
And yet dr king informs me
that at that time she was no longer alive.

1131
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:09,430
Now I put it to you that you returned
to the camp,

1132
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:14,059
you saw your stepmother,
and you discovered that she was dead.

1133
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:18,105
Did you tell anybody about this?
No, you did not.

1134
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:22,860
You pretended to talk to her,
and then you walked away.

1135
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:25,904
Now, why on earth should you do that?

1136
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:29,491
You, who could not possibly have been
guilty of her murder,

1137
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:34,913
because mrs boynton was dead
sometime before you returned to the camp.

1138
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:40,002
Your mind went back to that conversation
you had had aboard ship

1139
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,879
with your sister, Carol.

1140
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:46,842
Had she perhaps carried out your plan,
done the deed?

1141
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:50,220
Were you in some way
trying to protect her?

1142
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:51,805
That's a damned lie!

1143
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:57,227
Let us consider
the case against Carol boynton.

1144
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:02,316
Admitting that the murder was committed
by a lethal injection,

1145
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:06,528
we already know that dr king's syringe
had been tampered with,

1146
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:09,323
but there was another syringe.

1147
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:13,077
That found by miss Quinton
and claimed by whom?

1148
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:16,413
By none other than Carol boynton.

1149
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,501
What have you to say
to that, mademoiselle?

1150
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:22,127
It wasn't mine.

1151
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,838
But you claimed it, did you not?

1152
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,428
All right. All right, I believe you.

1153
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:35,349
You claimed the hypodermic
because that was the instrument

1154
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:39,812
which you and your coconspirator,
your brother Raymond, had selected.

1155
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,482
You were afraid
that he had killed your stepmother.

1156
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,859
You, in your turn, were protecting him.

1157
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,570
All right, monsieur poirot, you win.

1158
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,282
How did you conceive your plan, sir?

1159
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:54,451
I read it

1160
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,829
in a detective story.

1161
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:03,377
Sticking an empty hypodermic into someone
injects an air bubble which kills them.

1162
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,547
So you just purchased
the syringe yourself?

1163
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:09,675
No, I took the one Nadine had.

1164
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:13,887
The thing was, I dropped it
before I could use it.

1165
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:17,641
And then, when I found mother dead,

1166
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:24,231
I thought maybe Carol had...
Of course, it was incredible

1167
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:29,903
but the shock of finding
her dead like that...

1168
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:34,992
Thank you, mr boynton,
you may resume your seat.

1169
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:48,589
Time is pressing on, monsieur poirot, and
I can't see that this is leading anywhere.

1170
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,549
Can you, colonel carbury?

1171
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:54,261
Better let monsieur poirot proceed
in his own manner, dear lady.

1172
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:57,139
He usually gets there in the end.

1173
01:22:57,514 --> 01:23:00,642
Usually? Always.

1174
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:06,523
Who then was responsible for the killing?

1175
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:08,817
Dr king?

1176
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:14,823
Was she eager to free Raymond boynton
from his stepmother's clutches?

1177
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:18,702
No, because when dr king left
the encampment

1178
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,537
mrs boynton was still alive.

1179
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:23,790
When dr king returned,
mrs boynton was dead.

1180
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,793
This has been proved
by an independent medical report.

1181
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:32,466
And what of the youngest of our suspects?

1182
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:37,888
Oh, really, monsieur poirot.
That's not fair.

1183
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:41,058
I will not have Ginny
be accused of such a thing.

1184
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:42,643
Then what about you?

1185
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:47,314
It was you who acted as a
nurse to your mother-in-law.

1186
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,568
You were the last member of the family
to speak to her,

1187
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:56,406
which gave you unique opportunity
of plunging the hypodermic into her wrist.

1188
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,326
Also, you had a motive.

1189
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,787
What motive, for god's sake?

1190
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:04,248
Her love for you, sir.

1191
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:09,294
Yes, she behaved well towards
her mother-in-law simply because of you...

1192
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:12,589
Until she found out
that your spirit was broken.

1193
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:18,345
She tried to rouse you, to convince you
to break free, but she could not.

1194
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:24,518
And so, she determined
on one last desperate gesture,

1195
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:27,896
using the old trick ofjealousy.

1196
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:31,525
Oh, she was prepared to go further
than mere flirtation.

1197
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,403
She threatened to actually leave you.

1198
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:38,615
And if that failed,
there was only one alternative

1199
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:42,160
to eliminate
her mother-in-law's influence over you,

1200
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,914
by eliminating her mother-in-law.

1201
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:48,875
I killed her.

1202
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:51,461
Why?

1203
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:52,838
How can you ask?

1204
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:54,506
I am asking you, sir.

1205
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:57,676
Because of what she had done to us,
to our marriage.

1206
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:00,054
Your wife only told you of her decision
to leave you

1207
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:04,766
when she joined you down at the
excavations after mrs boynton was dead.

1208
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,602
What does it matter? I knew anyway.

1209
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:08,335
But it matters a great deal, sir.

1210
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:11,815
Look, I strongly advise
you to tell the truth.

1211
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,652
By god, I will.

1212
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:19,990
When we left the tents,
I knew it was all up unless I acted fast.

1213
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:24,786
It dawned on me that if! Made one decent
gesture, I could still save everything.

1214
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,289
What gesture, mr boynton?

1215
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:29,207
Same as Raymond's, I guess.

1216
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,292
I've had enough.

1217
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,020
To tell mother I was getting the hell out.

1218
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,045
I'm going down.

1219
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:37,132
My idea was to take Nadine away
that very night if she'd come with me.

1220
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:39,343
And when you reached the tents?

1221
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,970
Wake up, mother. Nadine and I have...

1222
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:45,098
I started to talk to her
till I realised she was dead.

1223
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,725
I didn't know what to do.

1224
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,394
You corrected the time on her watch?

1225
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:55,317
It was lying there in her lap. I just
acted mechanically. It was horrible.

1226
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,904
Then I walked down to the excavations.

1227
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:00,822
That is the truth, I swear.

1228
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:02,783
I believe you, mr boynton.

1229
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,662
Your explanation is consistent
not only with the facts,

1230
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:10,207
but also with your
psychological condition.

1231
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,294
This is all very interesting,
indeed touching,

1232
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:18,882
but I'm expected for cocktails
by lord peel in an hour and a half.

1233
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:24,596
You may continue with your exhibition,
monsieur poirot. I am going.

1234
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:31,978
Of course, lady westholme. Of course. Better
not be late for the loyal toast, what?

1235
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:36,024
Look, why don't we all go?
Everyone welcome.

1236
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:39,027
Celebrate George Mark vi,

1237
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:42,489
though I suppose I ought to say sorry
about your mrs Simpson.

1238
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,116
I'm very disappointed.

1239
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:48,745
I would have expected an American woman
to navigate skilfully onto the throne.

1240
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:54,918
Colonel carbury, were you asking us all
to the coronation ball tonight?

1241
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,586
I was, miss boynton.

1242
01:26:57,087 --> 01:26:58,213
Thank you.

1243
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,965
Sarah.

1244
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:03,552
I don't imagine
there'll be much in the way of boogying.

1245
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:04,761
Come on.

1246
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,264
Do you know who did it?

1247
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,307
I have until midnight, colonel.

1248
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:12,853
You didn't even mention that business
this morning with the arab boy.

1249
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:18,066
Well, that will come later.
It only confirms what I know already.

1250
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:21,737
Yes?

1251
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:24,489
The information you wanted
from america, sir.

1252
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,330
Has colonel carbury seen this?

1253
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:33,915
Seen what, old chap?

1254
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,422
I say, poirot,
what are you doing with that fellow?

1255
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,758
I thought you were supposed to be
working for me.

1256
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:47,721
Help me with my tie, would you please?
After all it's your coronation.

1257
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:14,873
It worked out well.

1258
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,936
The colonel's the best
dancer I've ever met.

1259
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:37,426
Not that you've met a lot, kid.

1260
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,605
He's better than you, ray.

1261
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:40,899
Oh, surely no one's better than ray.

1262
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:42,274
The colonel certainly is.

1263
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,778
- That's very sweet of you, my dear.
- That was fun.

1264
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:49,991
Monsieur poirot should not dance. Too fat.
Bad for the heart.

1265
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:54,079
I'd kind of like to know who did it,
monsieur poirot.

1266
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:55,330
Oh, does it matter?

1267
01:28:55,413 --> 01:28:58,041
I think it does. Will you tell us?

1268
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,877
What makes you so
sure it wasn't one of us?

1269
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,589
Well, I want you to consider two facts.

1270
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:09,094
First of all,
mrs boynton was taking digitalis...

1271
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:13,431
And secondly,
dr king here was missing a syringe.

1272
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:18,562
Now, quite clearly no member of the family
need have taken the risk of injecting it.

1273
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:23,275
All they had to do was to increase the
level of the digitalis to a fatal dose.

1274
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:28,280
At worst this could be attributed
to a mistake by the chemist who mixed it.

1275
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:31,992
If a syringe was used,
it was for a very good reason.

1276
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:36,413
It was that the murderer was not
sufficiently intimate with mrs boynton

1277
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:40,208
just to enter the tent and to tamper
with the medicine.

1278
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,378
Of all the suspects so far

1279
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:48,174
the most obvious one is mr cope.

1280
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,761
You, sir, were guilty of chicanery.

1281
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:58,310
I admit
that she forced me to burn the real will.

1282
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:02,898
Thank god that little injustice
was prolonged only for a few weeks.

1283
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:04,441
We forgive you, Jefferson.

1284
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:06,234
But he tried to cheat us.

1285
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:10,280
Well, goodness,
we were plotting to murder her.

1286
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,407
Go on, man.

1287
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:16,995
Mrs boynton took a particular pleasure
in preventing her family

1288
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:19,331
from associating with other people.

1289
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:22,125
And yet on the fatal afternoon

1290
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:26,296
she actually insisted that they left
and that they enjoy themselves elsewhere.

1291
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:27,505
Why?

1292
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:32,260
Well, you see,
mrs boynton had to get rid of the family,

1293
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:35,263
because, to use a vulgarity

1294
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:38,516
she had other fish for frying.

1295
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:45,774
What was it you said to her
in Jerusalem, dr king?

1296
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:48,485
I called her pathetic and ludicrous.

1297
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:53,198
There you have it. There was mrs boynton
confronted by herself,

1298
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:56,451
owing to the words
of an intelligent young woman.

1299
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:58,703
She was full of baffled fury.

1300
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:01,748
And then, suddenly,
while she was in this mood,

1301
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:05,585
there was a face from the past,
somebody she recognised,

1302
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:09,506
another victim to fall into her grasp.

1303
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,177
Consider her words to dr king.

1304
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,930
I never forget anything,

1305
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:20,308
not an action,

1306
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:22,352
not a name,

1307
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:23,895
not a face.

1308
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:27,565
Those words were spoken not to dr king,

1309
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:31,027
but to someone else
who was standing behind her.

1310
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:34,906
Let us reconstruct
what occurred on that fateful afternoon.

1311
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:36,950
The family went off on its jaunt.

1312
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,618
Lady westholme tells us

1313
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:43,873
that one of the arab servants
picked a quarrel with mrs boynton.

1314
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:47,794
You mean that one of those arab fellows
stuck her with a hypodermic?

1315
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:52,424
Both miss Quinton and lady westholme say

1316
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:56,720
they saw the arab boy emerge
from the tent occupied by Ginny,

1317
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:59,764
but dr king's tent was next door.

1318
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:04,185
It might quite easily have been
that tent to which they were referring.

1319
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:06,229
Lady westholme said:

1320
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:10,942
In addition, he was wearing a pair
of torn and patched breeches

1321
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:14,571
and his puttees were wound most untidily.

1322
01:32:14,904 --> 01:32:18,616
But lady westholme was sitting at her tent
200 yards away.

1323
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:20,744
She said she didn't see the face.

1324
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:25,206
How could she possibly have seen
the detail of clothing at such a distance?

1325
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:29,794
There was no arab who had an argument
with mrs boynton.

1326
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:34,758
The person who killed mrs boynton
was the same as the one that stood

1327
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:38,261
behind dr king in Jerusalem.

1328
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:44,225
Dr king.

1329
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,480
And it was the same one
who was standing behind me

1330
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:53,151
when I was waiting for the only witness
of the murder to meet me.

1331
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,487
Oh, it was no coincidence.

1332
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:58,907
Lady westholme's window
gave onto the very alley

1333
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:01,535
where the boy had asked me to meet him
the night before.

1334
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:06,539
She overheard, but she had no way
of finding him before our actual meeting.

1335
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:09,459
After that she took to the streets
like a hunter...

1336
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:13,379
And did not rest
until she had killed her quarry.

1337
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:18,760
Butjust a minute. Miss Quinton said
that mrs boynton was still alive

1338
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:21,930
when she and lady westholme
started out on their walk

1339
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:25,350
and she was certainly dead
by the time they got back.

1340
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:28,269
Miss Quinton agreed with lady westholme.

1341
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,939
She grunted like a pig.

1342
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:32,941
Most offensive.

1343
01:33:33,817 --> 01:33:38,947
But miss Quinton is easily suggestible.
Only yesterday in the lobby, I said:

1344
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:41,699
That is the largest
spider I have ever seen.

1345
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:44,619
Oh, yes. Spiders do not frighten me.

1346
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:46,788
There was, of course, no spider

1347
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:50,125
and mrs boynton at no time
grunted like a pig.

1348
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:53,378
I invented the spider.

1349
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:57,549
And as for mrs boynton, oh, she was dead.

1350
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:02,428
What happened was that lady westholme
went back to her tent.

1351
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:05,473
She made herself
a headdress out of a sheet

1352
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,314
And a duster, in this manner here...

1353
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,823
And some kind of a cord.

1354
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:27,453
Like this.

1355
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:34,460
Then she went into Ginny's tent by
mistake, hence the story of the sheik.

1356
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:38,381
She came out
and went into the tent of dr king.

1357
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:45,513
Here she finds the hypodermic
and fills it. Then she goes out

1358
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:50,518
to where mrs boynton is sitting,
grabs her wrist, and injects the poison.

1359
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:57,650
She leaves her sitting there
until miss Quinton returns

1360
01:34:57,775 --> 01:35:01,362
when lady westholme
invites her to go for a walk.

1361
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:07,744
But why should lady westholme,
of all people, want to murder mrs boynton?

1362
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,747
Lady westholme was born an American,

1363
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,876
but, of course,
she became more English than any native.

1364
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:19,923
Mrs boynton said she never forgot a face.

1365
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:24,260
Consider she was a wardress in a prison

1366
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:28,306
and your adjutant, colonel,
has confirmed my suspicion

1367
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,059
in a telephone call to the American police

1368
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:35,313
that lady westholme, prior to
her marriage, was a criminal,

1369
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:39,525
who served a prison sentence
in that very same prison.

1370
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:42,403
So stepmother was going to blackmail
lady westholme?

1371
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:45,907
Well, not conventional blackmail.
No, there was no money involved.

1372
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:49,953
It just gave her the opportunity
of torturing her victim for a while.

1373
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:52,497
Then she'd enjoy revealing the truth.

1374
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:54,457
In the most spectacular way.

1375
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:56,376
Precisely.

1376
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:59,171
Lady westholme knew that the days
of her influence were numbered,

1377
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:02,173
if mrs boynton could not be silenced.

1378
01:36:02,298 --> 01:36:03,675
Ladies and gentlemen,

1379
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:07,595
if you would care to go out to
the terrace, the fireworks await you.

1380
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:11,933
Fireworks, we've had them already.

1381
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:20,942
I'll see you later.

1382
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:40,503
Do you know what it is
to come from nothing?

1383
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:44,299
To climb inch by inch to respectability,

1384
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:48,261
to hear acclaim, to have position,

1385
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:51,806
to see all that turning to dust?

1386
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,267
She's better dead.

1387
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:56,853
The family rejoice.

1388
01:36:57,979 --> 01:37:00,148
Should I be the only one to suffer?

1389
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:04,235
Will you arrest me, monsieur poirot?

1390
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:07,447
That is up to colonel carbury, madame.

1391
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,241
Damn you.

1392
01:37:23,212 --> 01:37:26,132
Oh, I love that visual opulence.

1393
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:38,561
God bless the king.

1394
01:37:38,644 --> 01:37:41,244
Oh, look. The royal crown,
can you see it over there?

1395
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:46,027
Yes, how nice and royal.
It gives you confidence, I always think.

1396
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:56,162
Lady westholme's room.

1397
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:57,789
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Come on.

1398
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:58,873
What was that?

1399
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,249
What's going on?

1400
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,919
She died while cleaning her gun.

1401
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:05,254
What?

1402
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,507
Suicide would mean another investigation.

1403
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:12,720
She had trouble enough while alive.
Give her peace in death.

1404
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:20,228
A terrible accident, lord peel.

1405
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,815
There's nothing more that we could do.

1406
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:34,659
“The tragic death of lady westholme
occurred in Jerusalem yesterday.“

1407
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,911
while cleaning her gun as I deduced.

1408
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:39,914
She was ever a woman who knew her duty.

1409
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:43,835
How British for a woman
to take the gentleman's way out.

1410
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:46,045
She was American.

1411
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:49,966
Oh, hello.

1412
01:38:50,633 --> 01:38:52,635
Good-bye, hercule.
Good-bye, colonel carbury.

1413
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:55,304
You're going to america
with this young man?

1414
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:59,183
Oh, Ray's asked me to stay in america.
Only briefly, of course.

1415
01:38:59,725 --> 01:39:00,935
Of course.

1416
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:04,689
I'm going digging in america,
monsieur poirot.

1417
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,024
- Good-bye!
- Bye-bye.

1418
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:08,860
- Have a good time.
- Bon voyage!

1419
01:39:09,444 --> 01:39:12,572
Good-bye, monsieur poirot!
Good-bye, colonel carbury!

1420
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:16,701
Well, I hope they realise,
as andré gide did,

1421
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:19,370
that to free oneself is nothing.

1422
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:23,791
The really arduous task is to know
what to do with one's freedom.

1423
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:26,836
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1424
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,921
- Good-bye.
- Au revoir.

1425
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:33,885
Well, I think they'll be all right.

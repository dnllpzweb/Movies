1
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,085
Ooh!

2
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:33,936
Ooh!

3
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,112
All right, Curly, enough's enough.

4
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,940
You can't eat the Venetian blinds.

5
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:40,856
I just had them installed on Wednesday.

6
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,526
Down the hatch.

7
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,104
She's no good.

8
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:13,932
What can I tell you, kid?
You're right.

9
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:15,499
When you're right, you're right.

10
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:17,284
And you're right.

11
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,461
I'll pay you the rest next week.

12
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:23,420
We only caught
60 ton of skipjack
down in San Benedict.

13
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:25,030
And they don't pay you
the same for skipjack

14
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:26,815
as they do albacore or tuna.

15
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,120
Forget it, will you, Curly?

16
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:30,122
I only brought it up
to illustrate a point.

17
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,428
I don't want your last dime.

18
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,474
What kind of a guy do you think I am?

19
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:34,953
Thank you, Mr. Gittes.

20
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:36,303
Call me Jake.

21
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:38,914
Careful driving home, Curl, huh?

22
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:43,484
Mrs. Mulwray's waiting for you
with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

23
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:47,314
Mrs. Mulwray,
may I present Mr. Gittes?

24
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:50,142
Mrs. Mulwray, how do you do?

25
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:51,361
Mr. Gittes.

26
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,930
Now, what seems to be the problem?

27
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,193
My husband,

28
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,978
I believe, is seeing another woman.

29
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,460
No. Really?

30
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:04,983
I'm afraid so.

31
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,072
I am sorry.

32
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:10,598
Mr. Gittes, please,
do you think we could
discuss this alone?

33
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,341
I'm afraid not,
Mrs. Mulwray.

34
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:16,038
These are my operatives,

35
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:19,346
and at some point,
they're going to
have to assist me.

36
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,913
I can't do everything myself.

37
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:23,306
Of course not.

38
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,568
Now,

39
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,445
what makes you certain
that your husband is

40
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:34,274
involved with someone?

41
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,058
A wife can tell.

42
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:40,584
Mrs. Mulwray,
do you love your husband?

43
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,195
Yes, of course!

44
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,546
Then go home and
forget everything.
But, I...

45
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,939
I'm sure that he loves you,
too, Mrs. Mulwray.

46
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:51,900
Do you know the expression,
"Let sleeping dogs lie"?

47
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:55,382
You're better off not knowing.

48
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:57,122
I have to know.

49
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:02,650
Very well.

50
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:07,263
What is your husband's first name?

51
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,482
Hollis.

52
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:10,222
Hollis Mulwray.

53
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,573
Water and Power?

54
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:14,314
He's Chief Engineer.

55
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:17,534
Chief Engineer?

56
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:26,978
Mrs. Mulwray, this...

57
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:29,198
This type of investigation

58
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:31,331
can be hard on your pocketbook.

59
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:33,594
It takes time...

60
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:36,423
Money doesn't matter
to me, Mr. Gittes.

61
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,993
Okay, we'll...

62
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,083
We'll see what we can do.

63
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,651
Gentlemen, today you
can walk out that door,

64
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,959
turn right, hop a streetcar,
and within 25 minutes,

65
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:53,483
end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.

66
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:57,313
Now, you can swim in it
and you can fish in it,
but you can't drink it,

67
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,621
and you can't irrigate
an orange grove with it.

68
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:03,493
Now remember, we live
next door to the ocean,

69
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:06,453
but we also live on the edge of a desert.

70
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:09,325
Los Angeles is a desert community.

71
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,155
Beneath this building,
beneath our streets,
is a desert.

72
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:16,114
And without water,
the dust will rise up
and cover us

73
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,551
as though we never existed.

74
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:20,989
Now, the Alto Vallejo
can save us from this,

75
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:24,775
and I respectfully suggest
that $8.5 million

76
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,997
is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert
from our streets

77
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,172
and not on top of them.

78
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,303
Hear, hear!

79
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:40,008
Mayor Bagby, let's hear
from all the departments
again.

80
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:43,228
I suppose we'd better
take Water and Power first.

81
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:44,447
Mr. Mulwray?

82
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,113
In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,

83
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:01,638
over 500 lives were lost
when the Van der Lip Dam
gave way.

84
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:06,817
Core samples have shown
that beneath this bedrock

85
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:11,561
is shale similar to
the permeable shale
in the Van der Lip disaster.

86
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:14,651
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

87
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:18,394
And now you propose
yet another dirt-banked
terminus dam

88
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,615
with slopes of 2.5:1,
112 feet high,

89
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,226
and a 12,000-acre water surface.

90
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,663
Well, it won't hold.

91
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:30,058
I won't build it.
It's that simple.

92
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,756
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

93
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,323
Thank you, gentlemen.

94
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,810
Quiet! Quiet!

95
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,162
What the hell do you think you're doing?

96
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:49,425
Get those goddamn things out of here!

97
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,775
Hold some of them.
Tell me where to take them!

98
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,518
You don't have
an answer for that
so quick, do you?

99
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:58,782
You steal water
from the Valley,
ruin the grazing,

100
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,177
starve the livestock!

101
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,527
Who's paying you to do that,
Mr. Mulwray?

102
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,311
That's what I want to know!

103
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,948
Jeez, he was there all night.

104
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:56,601
That's right.

105
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,518
I had to go back three times
to pick up the watches.

106
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:08,178
Yesterday he went to three reservoirs,

107
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:11,878
a men's room at
a Richfield gas station,
and The Pig'n Whistle.

108
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:14,532
The guy's got water on the brain.

109
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:28,503
So what do you got?

110
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,309
This?

111
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:55,922
Well, they got into
a terrific argument
outside The Pig'n Whistle.

112
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,142
What about?

113
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:01,666
I don't know.
The traffic was pretty loud.

114
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,625
I heard only one thing, though.

115
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:04,844
"Apple core."

116
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,933
"Apple core"?

117
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,064
Yeah.

118
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:14,244
My God, Walsh,
is that what you
spent your day doing?

119
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:17,813
Look, you tell me
to take pictures,
I take pictures.

120
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,598
Let me explain something to you, Walsh.

121
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:22,035
J.J. Gittes and Associates.

122
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,603
This business requires
a certain amount of finesse.

123
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,825
What is it, Sophie?

124
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,783
Duffy's on the phone.

125
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:38,355
- Yeah, Duff, where are you?
- I got it!

126
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,010
He's found himself
some cute little twist,
the old buzzard...

127
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,664
Okay. Slow down.
Where are you?

128
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,535
I'm at Glendale and Douglas.

129
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,234
They're in Echo Park
in a rowboat. A rowboat!

130
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:48,757
Okay.

131
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,066
Echo Park.

132
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,197
Water again.

133
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:10,910
Okay, pal, let's have us a big smile.

134
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,049
You'll love it.

135
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,275
Here. Let me...

136
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,159
When you get so much publicity,

137
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,987
you got to get blase about it.

138
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,381
Let's face it, Jake,
you're practically
a movie star.

139
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,779
Just look at that, Barn.

140
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,346
Yeah, the heat's murder.

141
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:40,956
Sure is.

142
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,263
Fools' names and fools' faces.

143
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:48,311
What's that, pal?

144
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:49,399
Nothing.

145
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:52,185
You got a hell of a way to make a living.

146
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:55,753
Oh? And what do you do
to make ends meet?

147
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:58,713
Mortgage department, First National Bank.

148
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:02,934
Tell me, did you foreclose
on many families this week?

149
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:05,328
We don't publish
a record in the paper,
I can tell you that.

150
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:07,026
Neither do I.

151
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,680
No, you have your press agent do it.

152
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:10,986
Who is this bimbo, Barney?

153
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,988
Is he a regular customer or what?

154
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,816
Hey, listen, pal, I make an honest living.

155
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,905
People only come to me
when they're in
a desperate situation.

156
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:19,168
I help them out.
I don't kick families
out of their houses

157
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,778
like you bums down at the bank do!

158
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:22,302
Jake, can I tell you about the guy who...

159
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,130
Maybe you'd like
to step down out
of the barber chair

160
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:25,783
and maybe we can go outside
and discuss it.

161
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,307
What do you think?
Oh, come on.

162
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,656
Jake, let me tell you
about the guy
who got tired...

163
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,353
I don't know how that thing
got in the newspaper.

164
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,442
It was so quick,
I didn't even
know it myself.

165
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:33,835
Thank you.

166
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:34,966
I make an honest living!

167
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,403
Of course you do.

168
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,927
Anyway, this guy
who got tired of
screwing his wife

169
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,015
said to his friend,
"What do I do?"

170
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,542
An honest living, you understand?

171
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,323
So the guy says,
"Why don't you do
what the Chinese do?"

172
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,064
He says,
"What do the Chinese do?"

173
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:48,251
He says, "The Chinese
they screw a little
and they get tired..."

174
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,852
Duffy. Hey, Walsh!

175
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:54,377
Sophie, go to the
little girls' room
for a minute, okay?

176
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,031
But, Mr. Gittes...

177
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,206
Sophie...

178
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,035
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

179
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,123
Jake...
Duffy, listen to me, man.

180
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,472
I want to tell you a story.

181
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,822
So, there's this guy, Walsh,
you understand?

182
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,737
He's tired of screwing his wife.

183
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:08,217
Jake, there's a problem...
Wait a second, Duffy.

184
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:09,958
You're always in such a hurry.

185
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,829
So his friend says to him,

186
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:14,005
"Hey, why don't you do it
like the Chinese do?"

187
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,007
So he says, "Well, how
do the Chinese do it?"

188
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,226
The guy says, "Well, the Chinese,

189
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,793
"first they screw a little bit,

190
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:21,448
"then they stop and they go
and read a little Confucius.

191
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:24,407
"Come back,
screw a little bit more,
then they stop again,

192
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:26,366
"go back and they
screw a little..."
Jake.

193
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,846
Walsh, just listen to me for a second.

194
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,457
I mean, you'll love this.

195
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,503
Now, then they go back
and they screw
a little bit more,

196
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,766
and then they go out and
they contemplate the moon

197
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,856
or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.

198
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,556
So, now, the guy goes home
and he starts screwing
his own wife, see.

199
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,124
So, he screws her
for a little bit,
and then he stops.

200
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,952
He goes out of the room
and reads LIFEmagazine.

201
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:50,129
Then he goes back in,
he starts screwing again,

202
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,782
and he says, "Excuse me
for a minute, honey"

203
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,393
and he goes out and he smokes a cigarette.

204
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,960
Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.

205
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,006
He comes back in the room,
he starts screwing again,

206
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,139
he gets up to
start to leave again
to go look at the moon,

207
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,010
she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter
with you?

208
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:04,882
"You're screwing
just like a Chinaman!"

209
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:07,842
Jesus!

210
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,496
That Barney!

211
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,242
Mr. Gittes?

212
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,245
Yes.

213
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,551
Do you know me?

214
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:23,988
Well,

215
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:27,905
I think I would have remembered.

216
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:29,907
Have we ever met?

217
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:33,868
Well, no.

218
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,261
Never?

219
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:36,436
Never.

220
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,394
That's what I thought.

221
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,527
You see,
I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

222
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,007
You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?

223
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:47,838
Not that Mulwray?

224
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:50,319
Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.

225
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,932
And since you agree with me
that we've never met before,

226
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:58,153
you must also agree with me
that I've never hired you
to do anything,

227
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,851
certainly not spy on my husband.

228
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,419
I see you like publicity,
Mr. Gittes.

229
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:07,031
Well, you're going to get it.

230
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:09,251
Now, wait a minute,
Mrs. Mulwray.

231
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,384
I think there's been
some misunderstanding here.

232
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:13,212
There's no point in
getting tough with me.
I'm just...

233
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:16,215
I don't get tough
with anyone, Mr. Gittes.

234
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,999
My lawyer does.

235
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:22,221
Here's something
for you, Mr. Gittes.

236
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:28,618
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

237
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,244
Mr. Mulwray?

238
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,506
He's not in, Mr...

239
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,594
Gittes.

240
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:49,378
May I ask what this is regarding?

241
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:51,859
It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?

242
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:53,295
Since lunch.

243
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,602
Gee whiz, and I'm late.

244
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:57,038
He was expecting you?

245
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:58,344
Fifteen minutes ago.

246
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,520
Why don't I just go in and wait?

247
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,087
Sir?

248
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,963
Is Mr. Yelburton there?

249
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:12,053
Is he still in the building?

250
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,490
Very well. Thank you.

251
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:38,444
Can I help you?
Russ Yelburton,

252
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,359
Deputy Chief of the department.

253
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,099
J.J. Gittes.

254
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:44,667
It's not a departmental
matter, Mr. Yelburton.

255
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:47,104
I wonder if you'd care
to wait in my office.

256
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:48,236
Certainly.

257
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:51,500
We're a bit nervous around here

258
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:54,460
with all this business
in the papers about
Mr. Mulwray.

259
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,200
Right this way.

260
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:05,601
You know, after you've
worked with a man for
a certain length of time,

261
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,170
you come to know his habits, his values.

262
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:10,737
You come to know him.

263
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,609
And either he's the kind
who chases after women
or he isn't.

264
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:15,176
And Mulwray isn't?

265
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:17,396
He never even kids about it.

266
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:20,616
Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.

267
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,359
Sit down.

268
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,708
No, thank you.

269
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:28,102
Do you know where Mulwray's having lunch?

270
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:30,191
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

271
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:33,150
Well, tell him I'll be back.

272
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,414
I will.

273
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:37,764
Do you mind if I take one of your cards?

274
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:39,722
In case I have
to get in touch
with you again.

275
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:42,246
No, help yourself.
Thank you.

276
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:49,166
Mulvihill! What are
you doing here?

277
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,560
They shut my water off.
What's it to you?

278
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:54,781
How'd you find out about it?
You don't drink it.

279
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:57,523
You don't take a bath in it.

280
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,438
They wrote you a letter!

281
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,788
But then you'd have to be able to read.

282
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,140
Relax, Mulvihill.
Glad to see you.

283
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:07,707
You know Claude Mulvihill here?

284
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,449
Well, I hope so.
He's working for us.

285
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,667
Doing what?

286
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:13,321
Well, frankly, there have
been some threats

287
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:15,192
to blow up the city reservoirs.

288
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,542
Any particular reason?

289
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:17,760
Well, it's this darn drought.

290
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:19,240
We've had to ration water in the Valley

291
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:20,850
and the farmers are desperate.

292
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,244
But what can we do?
The rest of the city
needs drinking water.

293
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:24,680
Well, you're in luck,
Mr. Yelburton.

294
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,160
How's that?

295
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:28,597
When Mulvihill here
was Sheriff of
Ventura County,

296
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:32,122
the rum runners landed
hundreds of tons of
booze on the beach

297
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,647
and never lost a drop.

298
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,867
He ought to be able
to hold on to your
water for you.

299
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,539
J.J. Gittes
to see Mr. Mulwray.

300
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:05,694
Please.

301
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,929
You wait.

302
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:25,861
Bad for glass.

303
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:27,733
Yeah. Sure.

304
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:30,953
Bad for the glass.

305
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:08,861
Mr. Gittes.

306
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:12,386
Actually, I came to see
your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

307
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:16,782
Would you like something to drink?

308
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:18,044
What are you having?

309
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:19,480
Iced tea.

310
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:20,916
That'll be fine, thank you.

311
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,657
Two iced teas, Kahn, please?

312
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,093
Yes, ma'am.

313
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:27,531
My husband's at the office.

314
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,535
Actually, he's not,
Mrs. Mulwray,

315
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:34,060
and he's checked out
of his apartment at
the El Macondo.

316
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:36,932
That's not his apartment.

317
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:39,805
Anyway, I...

318
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:44,723
The point is, is I'm not
in business to be loved,
but I am in business,

319
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:47,116
and believe me, Mrs. Mulwray,
whoever set your husband up,

320
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,509
set me up.

321
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,729
L.A.'s a small town.
People talk.

322
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,426
I'm just trying to make a living.

323
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:54,428
I don't want to become a local joke.

324
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:56,082
Mr. Gittes,
you've talked me into it.

325
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,866
I'll drop the lawsuit.

326
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,086
What?
I said,
I'll drop the lawsuit.

327
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:02,479
So let's just drop the whole thing.

328
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:04,133
Sugar, lemon, or both?
Both.

329
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:06,092
Mrs. Mulwray...
Yes, Mr. Gittes?

330
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:08,442
...I don't want to drop it.

331
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,707
I better talk to your husband about this.

332
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,449
Why? What on Earth for?

333
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,692
Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

334
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,411
Well, I've been accused
of a lot of things before,
Mrs. Mulwray,

335
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:22,717
but never that.

336
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,675
Look, somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble here,

337
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:27,026
and lawsuit or no lawsuit,
I intend to find out.

338
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:30,507
I'm not supposed to be
the one who's caught
with his pants down.

339
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:32,901
So unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk
to your husband.

340
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:34,990
Why should it be a problem?

341
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:36,905
May I speak frankly,
Mrs. Mulwray?

342
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:39,081
You may if you can,
Mr. Gittes.

343
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,781
Well, that little girlfriend,
she was pretty,

344
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:45,044
in a cheap sort of a way, of course.

345
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:46,741
She's disappeared.

346
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,612
Maybe they disappeared together.

347
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:51,572
Suppose they did.
How does that affect you?

348
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,574
It's nothing personal,
Mrs. Mulwray.

349
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:54,793
It's very personal!

350
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:57,099
It couldn't be more personal.

351
00:29:58,057 --> 00:30:00,929
Is this business or an obsession with you?

352
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:02,975
Let's look at it this way.

353
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:06,805
Now, this phony broad,
excuse the language,

354
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,242
she tells me she's you.
She hires me.

355
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:11,635
Now, whoever put her up to it
doesn't have anything
against me.

356
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,811
They're out to get your husband.

357
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:15,465
If I can see him, I can help him.

358
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,949
Did you talk to him this morning?

359
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:22,821
No.

360
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,171
I went riding rather early.

361
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,913
Looks like you went quite a distance.

362
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,915
I was riding bareback.

363
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:32,743
You...

364
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:36,138
You might try the Oak Pass or
the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

365
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:38,053
Frequently, at lunch,
Hollis takes walks
around them.

366
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,707
Otherwise,
he'll be home by 6:30.

367
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,535
I'll stop by.

368
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:43,189
Please call first.

369
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,947
Sorry, closed to public, sir.

370
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:04,906
Oh, that's all right, Officer.

371
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:09,519
Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of
the department.

372
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:11,826
Sorry, Mr. Yelburton.
Go on down.

373
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,088
That's okay.

374
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,028
Gittes! For Christ's sake!

375
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,160
Loach.

376
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:42,248
Get out of here before he sees you.

377
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,597
What are you talking about?

378
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,904
What's going on here?
Loach!

379
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:48,950
Hello, Jake.

380
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,735
Lou. How are you?

381
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:57,654
Lousy cold
I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise, I'm okay.

382
00:31:57,698 --> 00:32:00,570
Yeah, summer colds are the worst.

383
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:01,876
Yeah, they are.

384
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,470
There's no smoking here, sir...

385
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:06,315
That's all right, Officer.
We can make an exception
this time.

386
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:09,710
I'll see he's careful
with the matches and
doesn't burn himself.

387
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:11,581
Thanks, Lou.

388
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,888
How'd you get past the guard?

389
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:17,283
Well, to tell you the truth,
I lied a little.

390
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:21,591
You look like you've
done well by yourself.

391
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:23,158
I get by.

392
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:26,161
Well, sometimes
it takes a while for
a man to find himself.

393
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:27,597
Maybe you have.

394
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:30,774
Yeah, going through
other people's
dirty linen.

395
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:34,691
Yeah. Tell me,
you still putting
Chinamen in jail

396
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:36,955
for spitting in the laundry?

397
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:40,001
You're a little behind the times, Jake.

398
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:42,221
They use steam irons now.

399
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,310
And I'm out of Chinatown.

400
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,355
Since when?

401
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,010
Since I made lieutenant.

402
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,273
Congratulations.

403
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,755
What are you doing around here?

404
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:56,278
I'm looking for somebody.

405
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:57,671
Who?

406
00:32:58,106 --> 00:33:00,326
Hollis Mulwray.
You seen him?

407
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,154
Yeah.

408
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,852
I'd like to talk to him.

409
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:07,811
So you'd like to talk to him, huh?

410
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:11,119
You're welcome to try.

411
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:13,992
There he is.

412
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:35,839
Looks like he was washed
down the entire length
of the run-off channel.

413
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,103
Could he swim?

414
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:39,234
Of course.

415
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:44,022
Obviously, the fall
must have knocked him
unconscious.

416
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:47,242
Mrs. Mulwray,

417
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:51,725
this alleged affair
your husband was having.

418
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,120
The publicity didn't make him

419
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:58,079
morose, or unhappy?

420
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:01,735
It didn't make him happy.

421
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:04,651
There is no possibility
that he would have
taken his own life?

422
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:05,869
No.

423
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:09,351
Mrs. Mulwray,

424
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:14,086
do you happen to know
the name of the young
lady in question?

425
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:16,141
No.

426
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:17,359
Or where she might be?

427
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:18,752
Certainly not.

428
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:21,450
You and your husband never discussed her?

429
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:24,279
He...

430
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,412
We did.

431
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:29,415
He wouldn't tell me her name.

432
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,287
We quarrelled over her, of course.

433
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:34,246
It came as a complete surprise to me.

434
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:36,291
A complete surprise?

435
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:38,946
I thought you hired
a private investigator.

436
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:42,167
A private investigator?

437
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,430
Mr. Gittes.

438
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:53,961
Yes, but I did that
because I thought
I would put an end

439
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:56,833
to a ridiculous rumor that had no basis.

440
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:58,313
Uh-huh.

441
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,447
When did Mr. Gittes inform you

442
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,232
that these rumors had
some foundation in fact?

443
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:07,366
Just before the story
broke in the papers, Lou.

444
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:11,021
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find her?

445
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,110
No.

446
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:13,894
Or her name?

447
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:15,113
No.

448
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,332
Of course not.

449
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,334
Will you need me
for anything else,
Lieutenant?

450
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:21,771
Oh, no, no, Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't think so.

451
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:25,123
If we need any
more information,
we'll be in touch.

452
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:28,474
Of course you have my deepest sympathy.

453
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:32,826
I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.

454
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,960
Jake, come on, what's the story?

455
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:38,962
Take it easy, guys.
Let us get through.

456
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,355
We better do this in a hurry.

457
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:43,793
Let us through, guys!
Give us a little room!

458
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,797
You want a picture, guys?
Here it is!

459
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,799
"Gittes", two T's and an E.

460
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:54,282
Thank you for going along
with me back there.

461
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:57,503
I just didn't want to explain anything.

462
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,983
I'll send you a check.

463
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:01,202
A check?

464
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:04,162
To make it official that I've hired you.

465
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:23,006
I'll get to him this afternoon if I can.

466
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,270
Jake, what are you doing here?

467
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:27,010
Nothing, Morty.
It's my lunch hour.

468
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,883
Thought I'd drop by
and see who dropped
dead lately.

469
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,580
Yeah? Isn't this something?

470
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,888
Middle of a drought,
and the Water Commissioner
drowns.

471
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,368
Only in L.A.

472
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:37,543
Yeah.

473
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:38,979
Looks pretty banged up.

474
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:41,024
Well, it's a long fall.

475
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,467
So how are you doing, Morty?

476
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,427
Never better, except for this darn cough.

477
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:53,515
You know me, Jake.

478
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,603
Yeah.

479
00:37:02,655 --> 00:37:04,526
Who you got there?

480
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,529
Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk.

481
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:11,054
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

482
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,406
Quite a character.

483
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:18,323
Lately he'd been
living in one of the
downtown storm drains.

484
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:23,066
Had a bureau dresser
down there and everything.

485
00:37:23,937 --> 00:37:25,243
All right, there.

486
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,903
Yeah. He drowned, too.

487
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,732
Come again?

488
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:40,040
Yeah. Got drunk,
passed out in the
bottom of the riverbed.

489
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,476
The L.A. River?

490
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:45,350
Yeah, right under
Hollenbeck Bridge.
What's wrong with that?

491
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:47,613
Well, it's dry as a bone, Morty.

492
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:50,224
It's not completely dry.

493
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,053
Well, he ain't gonna exactly
drown in a damp riverbed,

494
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:55,273
no matter how soused he is.

495
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,971
We got water out of him.
He drowned!

496
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:57,291
Hello.

497
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:06,082
Howdy.

498
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:09,695
You were riding out here
the other day, weren't you?

499
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:13,176
Do you speak English?

500
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,620
You were talking to
a man a few days ago.
He wore glasses...

501
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:23,230
Yes.

502
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:27,016
What did you talk about,
do you mind my asking?

503
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,322
The water.

504
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,715
What about the water?

505
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,281
When it comes.

506
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:32,370
When it comes?

507
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,763
What did you tell him?

508
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:37,505
It comes in different parts of the river.

509
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:39,725
Every night a different part.

510
00:42:01,214 --> 00:42:05,174
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn Florsheim shoe.

511
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:16,359
Hold it there, kitty-cat!
Hold it!

512
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:25,455
Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?

513
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:33,376
You're a very nosy fellow, kitty-cat, huh?

514
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,291
You know what happens to nosy fellows?

515
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:39,339
No? Want to guess? No?

516
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:41,167
Okay. They lose their noses.

517
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,914
Next time you lose the whole thing.

518
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:51,786
Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.

519
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:54,397
Understand?

520
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:56,791
Understand?
Don't you understand, Gittes?

521
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:58,663
I understand.

522
00:42:58,706 --> 00:43:00,229
All right.

523
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:13,373
So some contractor wants to build a dam,

524
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:15,810
and he makes a few payoffs.
So what?

525
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:17,595
Think you can nail Mulvihill?

526
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:19,509
They'll claim you were trespassing.

527
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:21,294
Don't want Mulvihill.

528
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:24,210
I want the big boys
that are making the payoffs.

529
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:25,603
Then what do you do?

530
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,387
Sue the shit out of them.

531
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,736
Yeah?
Yeah.

532
00:43:31,304 --> 00:43:32,827
What is it, Sophie?

533
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:34,524
A Miss Sessions is calling.

534
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:35,830
Who?

535
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:37,266
Ida Sessions.

536
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:41,314
Don't know her.
Take a number.

537
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,577
Sue people like that,

538
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,121
they're liable to be having
dinner with the judge
who's trying the suit.

539
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:50,976
I'm sorry.
Miss Sessions insists.

540
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:52,934
She says you know her.

541
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:54,849
Okay.

542
00:43:59,288 --> 00:44:00,725
Hello, Miss Sessions.

543
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:02,640
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

544
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:04,642
Oh, yes, we have.

545
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:05,730
Are you alone?

546
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:06,861
Isn't everyone?

547
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:09,995
What can I do for you?

548
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,651
Well, I'm a working girl.

549
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:15,957
I didn't come in to see you on my own.

550
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:17,872
When did you come in?

551
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:21,571
I was the one
who pretended to be
Mrs. Mulwray. Remember?

552
00:44:21,615 --> 00:44:22,660
Shut the fuck up.

553
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,313
Beg your pardon?

554
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,793
Yes, I remember.

555
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:27,795
Beg your pardon?
Is something wrong?

556
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,973
No. I was just checking
a detail or two with my
two associates.

557
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:33,496
Go on.

558
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,020
I never expected anything to happen

559
00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:36,891
like what happened
to Mr. Mulwray.

560
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:39,633
The point is, if it ever comes out,

561
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,636
I want somebody to know
that I didn't know
what would happen.

562
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,029
I understand.

563
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:46,509
Who was your employer?

564
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:47,902
That could be helpful to both of us.

565
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:49,512
Oh, no! Oh, no.

566
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:51,036
No.

567
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:54,996
What's your address?
Maybe we could
talk this over.

568
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,737
No, Mr. Gittes.

569
00:44:56,868 --> 00:44:59,479
Just look in the obituary column
of today'sL.A. Post-Record.

570
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:01,002
The obituary column?

571
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:02,874
You'll find one of those people.

572
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:05,354
"Those people"? Miss...

573
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:07,922
Sure.

574
00:45:09,097 --> 00:45:10,795
How do you like them apples?

575
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,828
Ma'am.

576
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:50,051
Thank you for coming.

577
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,756
Yes, sir?

578
00:45:58,799 --> 00:45:59,844
Drink?

579
00:46:01,106 --> 00:46:02,847
Tom Collins. With lime,
not lemon, please.

580
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,849
Tom Collins with lime.

581
00:46:08,156 --> 00:46:10,811
I got your check in the mail.

582
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:13,988
Yes. As I said,
I was very grateful.

583
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:18,471
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid
that's not good enough.

584
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,042
How much would you like?

585
00:46:24,085 --> 00:46:27,132
Oh, stop it,
the money's fine.
It's generous.

586
00:46:27,175 --> 00:46:32,137
But I think you
short-changed me
on the story.

587
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,095
I have?

588
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:35,793
I think so.

589
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:38,752
Something else besides
the death of your husband
was bothering you.

590
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,102
You were upset, but not that upset.

591
00:46:41,146 --> 00:46:44,149
Mr. Gittes,
don't tell me how I feel.

592
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:49,023
Sorry.

593
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,897
Look, you sue me, your husband dies,

594
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,203
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato,

595
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:58,641
all of it quicker
than the wind from
a duck's ass.

596
00:46:58,946 --> 00:47:00,469
Excuse me.

597
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:03,690
Then you ask me to lie to the police...

598
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:05,910
It wasn't much of a lie.

599
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:08,651
If your husband was killed, it was.

600
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:12,133
This could look like
you paid me off to
withhold evidence.

601
00:47:12,177 --> 00:47:14,048
But he wasn't killed.

602
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:19,662
Mrs. Mulwray, I think
you're hiding something.

603
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,017
Well,

604
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:29,542
I suppose I am.

605
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:33,198
Actually, I knew about the affair.

606
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:35,809
How did you find out?

607
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,202
My husband.

608
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:38,856
He told you?

609
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:41,989
And you weren't the least bit upset?

610
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,904
I was grateful.

611
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:48,082
Mrs. Mulwray,
you'll have to explain that.

612
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:49,257
Why?

613
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,608
Look, I do matrimonial work.
It's my metier.

614
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:55,568
When a wife tells me that
she's happy that her husband
is cheating on her,

615
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:58,092
it runs contrary to my experience.

616
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:00,094
Unless what?

617
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,925
She was cheating on him.

618
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,973
Were you?

619
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:16,197
I dislike the word "cheat".

620
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:18,983
Did you have affairs?

621
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:20,114
Mr. Gittes...

622
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:21,855
Did he know about it?

623
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:24,814
Well, I wouldn't run home and tell him

624
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:26,120
every time I went to bed with someone,

625
00:48:26,164 --> 00:48:28,601
if that's what you mean.

626
00:48:28,644 --> 00:48:31,044
Is there anything else
you want to know about me?

627
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:34,128
Where were you when your husband died?

628
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:36,217
I can't tell you.

629
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:37,958
You mean you don't know where you were?

630
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:39,612
I mean I can't tell you.

631
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:41,222
You were seeing someone, too.

632
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,922
For very long?

633
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:48,055
I don't see anyone
for very long, Mr. Gittes.

634
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:50,579
It's difficult for me.

635
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:57,282
Now, I think you know
all you need know about me.

636
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,372
I didn't want publicity.

637
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,288
I didn't want to go
into any of this,
then or now.

638
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:05,638
Is that all?

639
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:09,337
Oh.

640
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:13,167
By the way, what does this "C" stand for?

641
00:49:15,648 --> 00:49:16,779
"Cross."

642
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:20,740
It's your maiden name?

643
00:49:20,783 --> 00:49:21,871
Yes.

644
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:23,177
Why?

645
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,310
No reason.

646
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:27,921
You must've had a reason to ask me that.

647
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,792
No. I'm just a snoop.

648
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:39,063
No. I have my own car.
The Packard.

649
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:41,065
Wait a minute, sonny.

650
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:43,197
I think you better come with me.

651
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:45,678
But why? There's
nothing more to say.

652
00:49:45,721 --> 00:49:47,985
Will you get my car, please?

653
00:49:50,683 --> 00:49:52,163
Okay, go home.

654
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:55,993
But in case
you're interested,
your husband was murdered.

655
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:58,212
Somebody's been dumping
thousands of tons of water

656
00:49:58,256 --> 00:49:59,692
from the city's reservoirs,

657
00:49:59,735 --> 00:50:02,086
and we're supposed to be
in the middle of a drought.

658
00:50:02,129 --> 00:50:04,827
He found out about it, and he was killed.

659
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:06,829
There's a waterlogged drunk in the morgue.

660
00:50:06,873 --> 00:50:09,310
Involuntary manslaughter,
if anybody wants to
take the trouble,

661
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:10,790
which they don't.

662
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,922
It seems like half the city
is trying to cover it all up,

663
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:14,837
which is fine by me.

664
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,710
But, Mrs. Mulwray,

665
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:20,104
I goddamn near lost my nose,

666
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:21,366
and I like it.

667
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:23,368
I like breathing through it.

668
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:26,719
And I still think that
you're hiding something.

669
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:37,121
Mr. Gittes...

670
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:49,872
J.J. Gittes
to see Mr. Yelburton.

671
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,949
Mr. Yelburton will be
busy for some time.

672
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:26,822
Well, it's my lunch hour.
I can wait.

673
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,956
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

674
00:51:30,478 --> 00:51:32,741
I take a long lunch hour.

675
00:51:34,265 --> 00:51:36,789
All day, sometimes.

676
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:39,199
Noah Cross worked
for the Water Department.

677
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:40,505
Yes.

678
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:41,854
No.

679
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:42,985
Well, did he or didn't he?

680
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:45,031
He owned it.

681
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:48,861
He owned the Water Department?

682
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:50,036
Yes.

683
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:55,389
You mean, he owned
the entire water supply
for the city?

684
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:56,521
Yes.

685
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:04,485
How did they get it away from him?

686
00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:08,010
Mr. Mulwray felt
the public should
own the water.

687
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:10,012
Mr. Mulwray?

688
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:12,537
I thought you said Cross owned it.

689
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,495
Along with Mr. Mulwray.

690
00:53:15,627 --> 00:53:17,063
They were partners?

691
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:19,544
Yes! Yes, they were partners.

692
00:53:57,408 --> 00:54:00,106
Mr. Yelburton
will see you now.

693
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:07,983
Mr. Gittes,
sorry to keep you waiting.

694
00:54:08,027 --> 00:54:11,248
These staff meetings,
they just go on and on.

695
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:15,556
Yeah. Must be especially
tough to take over under
these circumstances.

696
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,560
Yes. Hollis was the
best department chief
the city's ever had.

697
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:22,650
My goodness, what happened to your nose?

698
00:54:22,694 --> 00:54:24,522
Cut myself shaving.

699
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:27,089
Well, you ought to be more careful.

700
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:28,874
That must really smart.

701
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:30,615
Only when I breathe.

702
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,012
Only when you breathe.

703
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:40,538
Don't tell me you're still
working for Mrs. Mulwray.

704
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:42,061
I never was.

705
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:43,280
I don't understand.

706
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:46,065
Neither do I, actually.

707
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:47,545
You hired me.

708
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:51,026
Or you hired that chippy to hire me.

709
00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:54,595
Mr. Gittes, you're not making
a bit of sense.

710
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:58,120
Well, let's look at it this way.

711
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:00,384
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.

712
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,603
He had a reputation
that was hard to get around.

713
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:04,605
You decided to ruin it.

714
00:55:04,649 --> 00:55:08,043
Then he found out
you were dumping
water at night.

715
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:10,307
Then he was...

716
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:12,004
Drowned.

717
00:55:12,744 --> 00:55:15,660
Mr. Gittes, that's
an outrageous accusation.

718
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,184
I don't know what you're talking about.

719
00:55:18,227 --> 00:55:22,144
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Timeswill.

720
00:55:22,188 --> 00:55:24,669
Dumping thousands
of gallons of water
down the toilet

721
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:27,585
in the middle of a drought, that's news.

722
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,153
Mr. Gittes,

723
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:33,373
we're...

724
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:36,463
We're not anxious for this to get around,

725
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:38,160
but we have been diverting a little water

726
00:55:38,204 --> 00:55:41,207
to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

727
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,469
As you know, the farmers out there

728
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:44,079
have no legal right to our water,

729
00:55:44,123 --> 00:55:45,603
but we've been trying
to help some of them out,

730
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:47,692
keep them from going under.

731
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:51,522
Naturally,
when you divert water,
there's a little run-off.

732
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:53,611
Yeah. A little run-off.

733
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:56,353
Where'd you say those groves were?

734
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:58,355
In the Northwest Valley.

735
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:01,183
That's like saying they're in Arizona.

736
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:03,229
Mr. Gittes,
my field men are out.

737
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:05,623
I can't give you the exact location.

738
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:08,147
You're a married man, aren't you?

739
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,278
Yes.

740
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:12,325
Hard-working? Wife? Kids?

741
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:14,327
Yes.

742
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,503
I don't want to nail you.

743
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:24,337
I want to find out who put you up to it.

744
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,600
I'll give you a few days
to think about it.

745
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:28,515
Call me. I can help.

746
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:30,865
Who knows?

747
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:34,129
Maybe we can put
the whole thing off
on a few big-shots,

748
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:35,696
and you can stay
the head of the department

749
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,655
for the next 20 years.

750
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,567
Drink?

751
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:21,699
No, thank you.

752
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:29,315
What is your usual salary?

753
00:57:30,229 --> 00:57:34,189
$35 a day, plus 20 to my associates,

754
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:36,453
plus expenses,

755
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:39,673
plus a bonus if I show results.

756
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:44,591
Whoever is behind my husband's death,

757
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:46,767
why have they gone to all this trouble?

758
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:48,203
Money.

759
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,598
How they plan to make it
out of emptying reservoirs,

760
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:53,470
that I don't know.

761
00:57:53,731 --> 00:57:55,602
I'll pay your salary,

762
00:57:55,646 --> 00:57:57,386
plus $5,000

763
00:57:57,822 --> 00:58:01,695
if you find out what
happened to Hollis,
and who is involved.

764
00:58:06,178 --> 00:58:10,312
Sophie, draw up one of
our standard contracts
for Mrs. Mulwray.

765
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:12,184
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

766
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,146
Tell me something.

767
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:21,236
Did you get married
before or after Mulwray
and your father

768
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,369
sold the Water Department?

769
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:26,372
Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?

770
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,637
Yes, of course.

771
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:33,248
It was sometime after.

772
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:37,514
I was just out
of grade school
when they did that.

773
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:42,475
Then you married
your father's
business partner.

774
00:58:45,304 --> 00:58:48,263
You've already got one going,
Mrs. Mulwray.

775
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:53,834
Does my talking
about your father
upset you?

776
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:55,357
Why, no.

777
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,273
Yes. A little.

778
00:58:58,317 --> 00:59:00,362
You see, Hollis and my...

779
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:02,843
My father

780
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,672
had a falling-out finally.

781
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:10,198
Over you or over the Water Department?

782
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:12,418
Not over me.
Why should it be over me?

783
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:14,202
Then it was over the Water Department.

784
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:15,290
Yes.

785
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:18,859
Hollis felt that the water
should belong to the public,

786
00:59:18,903 --> 00:59:22,733
and I don't think my father felt that way.

787
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:26,214
Actually, it was over the Van der Lip Dam.

788
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:27,520
You know, the dam that broke?

789
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,739
Oh, yeah?

790
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:30,915
Yes. Hollis never
forgave him for it.

791
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,960
Never forgave him for what?

792
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:35,397
For talking him into building it.

793
00:59:35,441 --> 00:59:37,878
They never spoke from that time on.

794
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:43,797
You sure about that?

795
00:59:44,755 --> 00:59:46,583
Of course I'm sure.

796
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:52,719
Sign here.

797
00:59:54,286 --> 00:59:55,940
The copy's for you.

798
01:00:58,045 --> 01:00:59,612
Mr. Gitts?

799
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,744
Gittes.

800
01:01:01,614 --> 01:01:03,094
How do you do?

801
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:07,533
You've got a nasty reputation,
Mr. Gitts. I like that.

802
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:09,796
Thanks.

803
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:11,537
If you were a bank president,
that would be one thing,

804
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,757
but in your business, it's admirable.

805
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,759
And it's good advertising.

806
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:17,021
It doesn't hurt.

807
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:20,372
It's why you attracted
a client like my daughter.

808
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:22,374
Probably.

809
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,332
But I'm surprised
you're still working
for her,

810
01:01:24,376 --> 01:01:26,857
unless she's suddenly come up
with another husband.

811
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,861
No. She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

812
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:34,908
How'd she get that idea?

813
01:01:35,561 --> 01:01:37,694
I think I gave it to her.

814
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:42,786
I hope you don't mind.
I believe they should
be served with the head.

815
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:46,006
Fine. Long as you don't
serve chicken that way.

816
01:01:48,052 --> 01:01:51,533
Tell me, what do the police say?

817
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:53,797
They're calling it an accident.

818
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:56,843
Who's the investigating officer?

819
01:01:56,887 --> 01:01:58,976
Lou Escobar.
He's a lieutenant.

820
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:00,673
Do you know him?

821
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,892
Oh, yeah.

822
01:02:02,066 --> 01:02:03,589
Where from?

823
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:07,027
We used to work together.
In Chinatown.

824
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:11,597
Would you call him a capable man?

825
01:02:12,424 --> 01:02:13,599
Very.

826
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:15,383
Honest?

827
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:16,994
As far as it goes.

828
01:02:18,517 --> 01:02:21,085
Of course, he has to swim
in the same water we all do.

829
01:02:21,128 --> 01:02:24,610
Of course, but you've
no reason to think
he's bungled the case?

830
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:25,872
None.

831
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:27,091
That's too bad.

832
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:29,571
Too bad?
Hmm.

833
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:31,704
It disturbs me.
Makes me think

834
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,880
you're taking my daughter for a ride.

835
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:36,491
Financially speaking, of course.

836
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:39,494
What are you charging her?

837
01:02:41,148 --> 01:02:45,413
My usual fee,
plus a bonus
if I get results.

838
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:47,502
Are you sleeping with her?

839
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,332
Come, come, Mr. Gitts.

840
01:02:51,506 --> 01:02:54,814
You don't have
to think about that
to remember, do you?

841
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:58,775
If you want an answer
to that question, Mr. Cross,

842
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:01,516
I'll put one of my men on the job.

843
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:04,868
Good afternoon.
Mr. Gitts...

844
01:03:04,911 --> 01:03:06,695
Gittes.
Gittes.

845
01:03:07,522 --> 01:03:10,743
You're dealing
with a disturbed woman
who just lost her husband.

846
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,137
I don't want her taken advantage of.

847
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,052
Sit down.
What for?

848
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:21,188
You may think you know
what you're dealing with,

849
01:03:21,232 --> 01:03:23,538
but believe me, you don't.

850
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,237
Why is that funny?

851
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,501
It's what the
District Attorney used
to tell me in Chinatown.

852
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:31,198
Yeah? Was he right?

853
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:35,681
Exactly what do you know
about me? Sit down.

854
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:43,167
Mainly that you're rich,

855
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:46,910
and too respectable
to want your name
in the newspapers.

856
01:03:46,953 --> 01:03:49,651
Of course I'm respectable.
I'm old.

857
01:03:51,218 --> 01:03:53,090
Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores

858
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:56,223
all get respectable
if they last long enough.

859
01:03:56,876 --> 01:04:00,097
I'll double
whatever your fee is
and pay you $10,000

860
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,664
if you find Hollis' girlfriend.

861
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,188
Girlfriend?

862
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,929
Disappeared, hasn't she?

863
01:04:05,972 --> 01:04:07,147
Yeah.

864
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:10,542
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?

865
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:11,804
Maybe.

866
01:04:13,284 --> 01:04:14,676
If Mulwray was murdered,

867
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,070
she'd be one of the last
to have seen him alive.

868
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:20,857
When's the last time you saw Mulwray?

869
01:04:22,206 --> 01:04:24,730
Sheriff's gold posse.
Bunch of damn fools

870
01:04:24,773 --> 01:04:28,734
who pay $5,000 apiece
towards the Sheriff's
re-election.

871
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:31,737
I let them practice up out here.

872
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah.

873
01:04:35,784 --> 01:04:38,744
Do you remember the last time
you saw Mulwray?

874
01:04:38,787 --> 01:04:41,181
At my age, you tend to forget.

875
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:45,577
It was five days ago
outside The Pig'n Whistle,

876
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,232
and you had one hell of an argument.

877
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:50,147
I got the pictures in my office,

878
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,236
if that'll help you remember.

879
01:04:55,326 --> 01:04:57,197
What was the argument about?

880
01:04:57,241 --> 01:04:58,807
My daughter.

881
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,898
What about her?

882
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:06,163
Just find the girl, Mr. Gitts.

883
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:13,257
I happen to know Hollis was fond of her.

884
01:05:14,214 --> 01:05:16,347
I'd like to help her if I can.

885
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:20,220
I had no idea you and
Hollis were that fond
of one another.

886
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:23,658
Hollis Mulwray made this city,

887
01:05:24,224 --> 01:05:26,270
and he made me a fortune.

888
01:05:28,098 --> 01:05:31,188
We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.

889
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:38,760
If you want to hire me,
I still have to know what
the argument was about.

890
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:42,199
My daughter's a very jealous woman.

891
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:45,245
I didn't want her to
find out about the girl.

892
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,639
How did you find out?

893
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:51,817
I still got a few
teeth left in my head,
and a few friends in town.

894
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,952
Okay.

895
01:05:57,692 --> 01:05:58,955
I'll...

896
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,220
I'll have my secretary draw up the papers.

897
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,178
Tell me,

898
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:07,833
are you frightened for the girl

899
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:10,575
or what Evelyn might do to her?

900
01:06:10,618 --> 01:06:12,272
Just find the girl.

901
01:06:13,926 --> 01:06:15,797
I'll look into it,

902
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:18,931
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

903
01:06:19,845 --> 01:06:21,281
Orange groves?

904
01:06:22,326 --> 01:06:24,806
We'll be in touch,
Mr. Cross.

905
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:32,075
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you
could you tell me

906
01:06:32,118 --> 01:06:34,903
where the plat books
for the Northwest Valley are?

907
01:06:34,947 --> 01:06:36,862
Part of it's in Ventura County.

908
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:40,257
We don't have Ventura County
in our Hall of Records.

909
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:44,000
Well, then, I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.

910
01:06:44,826 --> 01:06:46,393
Row 23, section C.

911
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,182
Weasel.

912
01:07:47,802 --> 01:07:49,108
Say, sonny,

913
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:55,071
why do they have
all those names pasted
in the plat books?

914
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:58,770
Land sales out of escrow
are always recorded
within the week.

915
01:07:58,813 --> 01:08:00,250
Then these are all new owners?

916
01:08:00,293 --> 01:08:01,903
That's right.

917
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:06,473
Well, that means
that most of the Valley
sold in the last few months.

918
01:08:06,517 --> 01:08:08,475
If that's what it says.

919
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,958
Can I check one of these volumes out?

920
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:15,961
Sir, this is not a lending library.

921
01:08:16,004 --> 01:08:18,006
It's the Hall of Records.

922
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,747
How about a ruler?

923
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,401
A ruler?

924
01:08:22,794 --> 01:08:25,231
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.

925
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:27,973
I'd like to be able to read across.

926
01:08:39,854 --> 01:08:41,378
Why, thank you.

927
01:09:48,532 --> 01:09:49,968
Hold it right there!

928
01:10:59,037 --> 01:11:01,300
All right, quit it.
Quit, now!

929
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:03,955
Search the man.
See if he's armed.

930
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:20,145
I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!

931
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:22,452
Search him. Search him!

932
01:11:23,627 --> 01:11:25,498
He ain't armed.

933
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:27,152
All right, mister, who you with,

934
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:30,286
the Water Department
or the Real Estate Office?

935
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,636
Get away from me!
Answer him!

936
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:34,246
You come near me with that thing again,

937
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,512
you're gonna need a pair of them!

938
01:11:35,595 --> 01:11:37,293
Why don't you
pick on somebody
your own size?

939
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:41,297
I said cut that out!
Give the man a chance
to say something!

940
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:48,608
The name's Gittes.
I'm a private investigator.

941
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:50,252
I'm not with either one of them.

942
01:11:51,568 --> 01:11:54,048
Then what you doing out here, mister?

943
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,312
A client hired me to see...

944
01:11:57,443 --> 01:12:00,272
To see if the
Water Department was
irrigating your land.

945
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,143
Irrigating my land?

946
01:12:02,187 --> 01:12:03,888
The Water Department's
been sending you
people out here

947
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:06,539
to blow up my water tanks,
they put poison down
three of my wells.

948
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:08,715
I call that a funny way to irrigate.

949
01:12:08,759 --> 01:12:11,501
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

950
01:12:16,636 --> 01:12:18,203
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

951
01:12:18,246 --> 01:12:21,293
Mulwray?
That's the son of a bitch
who's done it to us.

952
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,077
Mulwray's dead.
You don't know what

953
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:25,732
you're talking about, you dumb Okie.

954
01:12:33,218 --> 01:12:34,611
Well, that's that.

955
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,118
What's going on?

956
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,251
You didn't look too good,

957
01:13:06,294 --> 01:13:09,254
so we thought we better
call your employer.

958
01:13:13,693 --> 01:13:15,521
Thanks for coming.

959
01:13:19,656 --> 01:13:21,658
That dam's a con job.

960
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:22,789
What dam?

961
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,661
The one your husband opposed.

962
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:26,706
They're conning L.A.
into building it.

963
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,535
But the water's
not gonna go to L.A.,
it's coming right here.

964
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:30,754
To the Valley?

965
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:33,409
Everything you can see.
Everything around us.

966
01:13:33,452 --> 01:13:35,802
I was at the Hall of Records today.

967
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,117
In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought
7,000 acres,

968
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,686
Emma Dill, 12,000, Clarence Speer, 5,000,

969
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:53,167
and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.

970
01:13:53,211 --> 01:13:55,256
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
You know him?

971
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,302
I think I would've remembered.

972
01:13:57,345 --> 01:13:59,130
Yeah.

973
01:13:59,173 --> 01:14:00,827
They're blowing these farmers
out of their land

974
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:02,699
and then picking it up for peanuts.

975
01:14:02,829 --> 01:14:07,181
You have any idea what
this land would be worth
with a steady water supply?

976
01:14:07,225 --> 01:14:10,184
About $30 million more
than they paid for it.

977
01:14:11,838 --> 01:14:13,753
Hollis knew about this?

978
01:14:13,797 --> 01:14:15,451
That's why he was killed.

979
01:14:17,322 --> 01:14:19,193
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

980
01:14:19,846 --> 01:14:21,805
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

981
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,287
We got it!
What?

982
01:14:26,331 --> 01:14:27,854
We got it.
What? What is it?

983
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:31,162
"A memorial service was held
at the Mar Vista Inn today

984
01:14:31,205 --> 01:14:32,293
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb."

985
01:14:32,337 --> 01:14:34,600
He passed away two weeks ago.

986
01:14:35,645 --> 01:14:37,385
Why is that unusual?

987
01:14:37,777 --> 01:14:41,564
He passed away two weeks
ago, and one week ago
he bought the land.

988
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:43,304
That's unusual.

989
01:15:26,957 --> 01:15:30,395
Hello, there. I'm Mr. Palmer.
Can I help you folks?

990
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:32,615
Yes, I hope so.

991
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,400
It's Dad.

992
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:37,358
I can't seem to handle him anymore.

993
01:15:37,402 --> 01:15:38,621
Can I, sweetheart?

994
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:39,883
My goodness.

995
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:42,668
Nothing with Dad. It's me.

996
01:15:42,712 --> 01:15:45,323
Oh, no, no, Dad is
an absolute angel
with everyone else.

997
01:15:45,366 --> 01:15:46,629
It's just that he and my...

998
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:48,544
Oh, I don't know.

999
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:51,372
Of course, I'm anxious
for him to have the best,

1000
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:53,374
and money is no object.

1001
01:15:53,418 --> 01:15:55,942
Perhaps if we met with your father.

1002
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:57,944
There is one question.

1003
01:15:57,988 --> 01:15:59,555
Of course.

1004
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:02,645
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

1005
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:05,386
I'm sorry, but we don't.

1006
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,953
Don't be sorry.
Neither does Dad.

1007
01:16:06,997 --> 01:16:10,261
We just wanted to be sure, didn't we, hon?

1008
01:16:10,304 --> 01:16:12,393
Would it be possible for me to see

1009
01:16:12,437 --> 01:16:14,570
a list of your patients,
just to be certain?

1010
01:16:14,613 --> 01:16:18,748
We never reveal the
names of our guests
as a matter of policy.

1011
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:20,924
You would appreciate
that if your father
came to live with us.

1012
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:24,362
That's exactly
what I wanted
to hear you say.

1013
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:25,798
Good.

1014
01:16:25,885 --> 01:16:27,931
I wonder, is it too late
for us to have a look around?

1015
01:16:27,974 --> 01:16:29,410
No. Allow me to show you.

1016
01:16:29,454 --> 01:16:32,022
Would you mind if we took
a stroll on our own?

1017
01:16:32,065 --> 01:16:34,546
Just if you'll
confine yourself
to the main building.

1018
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,461
It's almost bedtime.

1019
01:16:36,504 --> 01:16:39,682
We understand.
Come, my sweet.

1020
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:54,740
Charlie!
You ought to know
better than that!

1021
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:56,699
Sit down. Have a chair.

1022
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:19,635
They're all there.
Every goddamn name.

1023
01:17:25,684 --> 01:17:29,340
You're looking at the owners
of a 50,000-acre empire.

1024
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:30,776
They can't be.

1025
01:17:35,433 --> 01:17:37,914
They may not know it, but they are.

1026
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,352
- Hello, girls.
- Hello.

1027
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:42,527
Hello.

1028
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:43,876
Are any of you Emma Dill?

1029
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,923
Yes? Are you Emma?

1030
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:48,402
Yes.

1031
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:50,927
Well, I've been wanting
to meet you for a long time.

1032
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,189
Why?

1033
01:17:52,232 --> 01:17:54,452
Did you know you were
a very wealthy woman?

1034
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:56,410
Oh, I'm not.

1035
01:17:56,454 --> 01:17:58,891
Yes, you are.
You own a lot of land.

1036
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:00,763
No more.

1037
01:18:01,372 --> 01:18:02,634
Some time ago,

1038
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,592
my late husband owned a good deal

1039
01:18:04,636 --> 01:18:06,638
of beach property at Long Beach,

1040
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,422
but we lost it.

1041
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:10,555
That's very beautiful.

1042
01:18:10,598 --> 01:18:11,948
Thanks.

1043
01:18:11,991 --> 01:18:14,037
Where did you get this piece of material?

1044
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,952
At the Abbacore Club.

1045
01:18:16,387 --> 01:18:17,954
Abbacore?

1046
01:18:17,997 --> 01:18:19,956
No. The Albacore.

1047
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:22,001
It's a fish.

1048
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:26,832
My grandson is a member,
and they take very nice
care of us.

1049
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:28,878
How do they do that?

1050
01:18:28,921 --> 01:18:32,925
Oh, give us things,
not just like this
old flag, but...

1051
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:34,927
But what?

1052
01:18:35,058 --> 01:18:37,930
We're a sort of
unofficial charity
of theirs, Mr. Gittes.

1053
01:18:39,105 --> 01:18:40,716
Would you come with me, please?

1054
01:18:40,759 --> 01:18:43,109
Someone wants to talk with you.

1055
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:46,983
Goodbye, ladies.

1056
01:18:47,026 --> 01:18:48,071
Bye!

1057
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:59,560
Come on. I want you
to meet someone, Gittes.

1058
01:18:59,604 --> 01:19:01,693
Can we leave the lady out of this?

1059
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,086
Yeah. Why not?

1060
01:19:03,129 --> 01:19:05,001
I'd like to see her to the car.

1061
01:19:05,044 --> 01:19:06,872
She knows where it's at.

1062
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:08,134
I'll stay.

1063
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:10,093
Get in the car.

1064
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,566
Maid's night off?

1065
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,091
Why?

1066
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:36,570
What do you mean, why?

1067
01:20:36,614 --> 01:20:37,963
Nobody's here, that's why.

1068
01:20:38,007 --> 01:20:40,531
I gave everyone the night off.

1069
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:43,664
Easy. It's an innocent
question.

1070
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:46,798
No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.

1071
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,713
I guess you're right.

1072
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,718
To you, Mrs. Mulwray.

1073
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:57,591
Frankly, tonight, you saved my...

1074
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,680
You saved my neck.

1075
01:21:02,727 --> 01:21:04,598
Tell me, Mr. Gittes,

1076
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,211
does this often happen to you?

1077
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,257
What's that?

1078
01:21:12,171 --> 01:21:13,738
Well, I'm judging only on the basis

1079
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:15,087
of one afternoon and an evening,

1080
01:21:15,131 --> 01:21:17,263
but if this is how you go about your work,

1081
01:21:17,307 --> 01:21:21,137
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

1082
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:25,706
Actually, this hasn't
happened to me
for a long time.

1083
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,752
When was the last time?

1084
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:29,580
Why?

1085
01:21:30,189 --> 01:21:32,235
It's an innocent question.

1086
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:38,589
In Chinatown.

1087
01:21:39,068 --> 01:21:40,721
What were you doing there?

1088
01:21:42,767 --> 01:21:44,247
Working for the District Attorney.

1089
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:46,162
Doing what?

1090
01:21:46,205 --> 01:21:48,077
As little as possible.

1091
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,645
The District Attorney gives
his men advice like that?

1092
01:21:52,342 --> 01:21:54,257
They do in Chinatown.

1093
01:21:55,649 --> 01:21:58,043
Why did you leave the police force?

1094
01:22:01,786 --> 01:22:07,183
Do you have any peroxide,
or anything like that?

1095
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:09,925
Surely.
Will you come this way?

1096
01:22:27,203 --> 01:22:28,944
My God!

1097
01:22:32,338 --> 01:22:34,079
It's a nasty cut.

1098
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:37,822
I had no idea...

1099
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,089
Sorry!

1100
01:22:45,264 --> 01:22:46,657
There.

1101
01:22:47,658 --> 01:22:49,094
Is it painful?

1102
01:22:49,312 --> 01:22:50,704
Mmm-hmm.

1103
01:22:52,706 --> 01:22:54,317
It must be painful.

1104
01:22:56,362 --> 01:22:57,973
What's wrong?

1105
01:22:58,799 --> 01:23:00,062
Your eye.

1106
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:05,154
What about it? What?

1107
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:09,245
There's something black
in the green part
of your eye.

1108
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:11,203
Oh, that.

1109
01:23:11,812 --> 01:23:16,078
It's a flaw in the iris.

1110
01:23:17,296 --> 01:23:18,341
A flaw?

1111
01:23:18,384 --> 01:23:19,733
Yes.

1112
01:23:20,865 --> 01:23:22,998
A sort of birthmark.

1113
01:23:58,772 --> 01:24:00,774
Did you wear a uniform?

1114
01:24:02,341 --> 01:24:03,864
Sometimes.

1115
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:08,130
Must have looked cute in blue.

1116
01:24:10,175 --> 01:24:12,177
Give me a break, will you?

1117
01:24:12,786 --> 01:24:14,397
I don't know you.

1118
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:18,140
I want to know more about you.

1119
01:24:18,749 --> 01:24:20,055
Not now.

1120
01:24:22,274 --> 01:24:25,799
You really don't like to talk
about the past, do you?

1121
01:24:28,237 --> 01:24:29,760
I'm tired.

1122
01:24:30,456 --> 01:24:33,459
No. Why does it bother you
to talk about it?

1123
01:24:34,112 --> 01:24:36,332
It bothers everybody that works there.

1124
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:37,724
Where?

1125
01:24:38,334 --> 01:24:40,162
Chinatown. Everybody.

1126
01:24:41,511 --> 01:24:43,904
To me, it was just bad luck.

1127
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:45,297
Why?

1128
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:50,955
You can't always tell what's going on.

1129
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,480
Like with you.

1130
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,448
Why was...

1131
01:25:07,928 --> 01:25:09,800
Why was it bad luck?

1132
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,503
I was trying to keep
someone from being hurt.

1133
01:25:18,287 --> 01:25:21,203
I ended up making sure that she was hurt.

1134
01:25:29,428 --> 01:25:32,127
Was there a woman involved?

1135
01:25:33,867 --> 01:25:35,217
Of course.

1136
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:38,002
Dead?

1137
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,843
Yes, hello?

1138
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:59,415
Oh, my God.
No, look, don't do anything.

1139
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:02,157
Don't do anything until I get there.

1140
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:09,033
I have to go.

1141
01:26:09,555 --> 01:26:11,383
Where?

1142
01:26:11,427 --> 01:26:13,342
Just that I have to.

1143
01:26:13,951 --> 01:26:15,213
I want to know where you're going.

1144
01:26:15,257 --> 01:26:18,042
No, please. Don't be angry.

1145
01:26:18,085 --> 01:26:20,958
It has nothing to do with you
or with any of all of this.
It's just...

1146
01:26:21,001 --> 01:26:22,307
Where are you going?

1147
01:26:22,351 --> 01:26:23,395
Please...

1148
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:28,052
Trust me this much.

1149
01:26:38,628 --> 01:26:40,195
I'll be back.

1150
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:47,202
And there is...

1151
01:26:49,073 --> 01:26:51,597
There is something that
I should tell you about.

1152
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:56,036
The fishing club
that old lady mentioned...

1153
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:00,563
The pieces of the flag...
Yes.
The Albacore Club.

1154
01:27:00,606 --> 01:27:02,173
It has to do with my father.

1155
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,348
I know.

1156
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:06,046
He owns it... You know?

1157
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,310
I saw him.

1158
01:27:11,965 --> 01:27:13,315
You saw

1159
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:15,578
my father?

1160
01:27:19,103 --> 01:27:20,452
What... When?

1161
01:27:21,061 --> 01:27:22,367
This morning.

1162
01:27:25,109 --> 01:27:26,937
You didn't tell me.

1163
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,592
Well, there hasn't been much time.

1164
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:31,376
What...

1165
01:27:32,116 --> 01:27:33,639
What did he say?

1166
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,951
What did he say?

1167
01:27:41,386 --> 01:27:43,345
That you were jealous.

1168
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:47,044
And that he was afraid what you might do.

1169
01:27:47,087 --> 01:27:49,264
Do? To whom?

1170
01:27:50,439 --> 01:27:52,658
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one.

1171
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,489
He wanted to know where she was.

1172
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:02,973
I want you to listen to me.

1173
01:28:03,016 --> 01:28:07,543
Now, my father is a very dangerous man.

1174
01:28:07,586 --> 01:28:11,286
You don't know how dangerous.
You don't know how crazy.

1175
01:28:12,461 --> 01:28:15,942
Are you trying to tell me
that he might be
behind all this?

1176
01:28:15,986 --> 01:28:17,379
It's possible.

1177
01:28:24,037 --> 01:28:26,518
Even the death of your husband?

1178
01:28:26,562 --> 01:28:28,303
It's possible.

1179
01:28:28,346 --> 01:28:30,566
Now, please,
don't ask me any
more questions now,

1180
01:28:30,609 --> 01:28:32,698
just wait. Wait for me here.

1181
01:28:34,004 --> 01:28:35,571
I need you here.

1182
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,239
No, no. Here.

1183
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,401
Give me the keys.

1184
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:20,883
You...

1185
01:32:21,057 --> 01:32:24,321
It's either that or
you drive yourself
to the police.

1186
01:32:24,364 --> 01:32:25,670
The police?

1187
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:27,846
Come on, Mrs. Mulwray.

1188
01:32:27,977 --> 01:32:31,502
You've got your
husband's girlfriend
tied up in there.

1189
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,677
She's not tied up.

1190
01:32:32,721 --> 01:32:33,809
You know what I mean.

1191
01:32:33,852 --> 01:32:35,375
You're holding her against her will.

1192
01:32:35,419 --> 01:32:36,855
I am not!

1193
01:32:38,335 --> 01:32:39,684
Okay. Then let's
go talk to her.

1194
01:32:39,728 --> 01:32:40,946
No!

1195
01:32:42,687 --> 01:32:44,210
She's...

1196
01:32:44,254 --> 01:32:45,821
She's too upset.

1197
01:32:47,692 --> 01:32:48,954
What about?

1198
01:32:49,738 --> 01:32:51,304
Hollis's death.

1199
01:32:52,436 --> 01:32:54,220
I tried to keep it from her.

1200
01:32:54,264 --> 01:32:58,311
I didn't want her to know
until I could make plans
for us to leave.

1201
01:32:58,355 --> 01:33:00,923
You mean she just found out about it?

1202
01:33:03,012 --> 01:33:05,971
That's not what
it looks like,
Mrs. Mulwray.

1203
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:08,583
What does it look like?

1204
01:33:08,626 --> 01:33:11,716
Like she knows more
than you want her to tell.

1205
01:33:13,326 --> 01:33:14,937
You're insane.

1206
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:17,592
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not the police.

1207
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:21,334
I don't care
what you've done.
I don't want to hurt you.

1208
01:33:25,469 --> 01:33:27,819
You won't go to the police if I tell you?

1209
01:33:27,863 --> 01:33:29,691
I will if you don't.

1210
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:44,967
She...

1211
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:46,446
She...

1212
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,492
She...

1213
01:33:49,754 --> 01:33:51,451
She's my sister.

1214
01:33:57,762 --> 01:33:59,372
Take it easy.

1215
01:34:00,025 --> 01:34:02,854
If she's your sister, she's your sister.

1216
01:34:03,507 --> 01:34:05,378
Why all the secrecy?

1217
01:34:07,511 --> 01:34:08,773
I can't.

1218
01:34:08,817 --> 01:34:10,470
Is it because of Hollis?

1219
01:34:10,514 --> 01:34:13,517
Because she was seeing
your husband? Is that it?

1220
01:34:17,564 --> 01:34:19,915
I would never have harmed Hollis.

1221
01:34:20,959 --> 01:34:24,746
He was the most gentle,
decent man imaginable.

1222
01:34:27,009 --> 01:34:30,882
And he put up
with more from me
than you'll ever know.

1223
01:34:33,406 --> 01:34:36,932
I wanted him to be happy.

1224
01:34:55,951 --> 01:34:57,648
I borrowed your husband's car.

1225
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:00,085
I'll bring it back in the morning.

1226
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:03,088
But aren't you going...
Coming back with me?

1227
01:35:03,132 --> 01:35:05,961
Don't worry. I'm not going
to tell anybody about this.

1228
01:35:08,006 --> 01:35:09,965
That's not what I meant.

1229
01:35:13,446 --> 01:35:14,578
Yeah.

1230
01:35:15,492 --> 01:35:19,061
Well, I'm tired, Mrs. Mulwray.

1231
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:21,716
Good night.

1232
01:36:27,085 --> 01:36:28,478
Gittes?

1233
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:31,176
Gittes?
Yeah?

1234
01:36:31,829 --> 01:36:34,092
Ida Sessions wants to see you.

1235
01:36:34,136 --> 01:36:35,485
Who?

1236
01:36:35,528 --> 01:36:37,879
Ida Sessions.
You remember Ida.

1237
01:36:39,532 --> 01:36:40,620
Yeah, I do?

1238
01:36:40,664 --> 01:36:41,796
Sure, you do.

1239
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:47,105
I tell you what, pal.

1240
01:36:48,237 --> 01:36:52,632
If Ida wants to see me,
she can call me at my office.

1241
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:24,099
848-1/2 East Kensington. Echo Park.

1242
01:37:24,142 --> 01:37:26,342
She begged me to call.
She's waiting for you.

1243
01:40:34,854 --> 01:40:37,248
Find anything interesting, Gittes?

1244
01:40:41,731 --> 01:40:43,776
What are you doing around here?

1245
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:45,691
Didn't you call me?

1246
01:40:47,302 --> 01:40:49,826
How come you happen to know her?

1247
01:40:50,087 --> 01:40:51,349
I don't.

1248
01:40:54,222 --> 01:40:57,051
Come here.
I want to show you something.

1249
01:41:06,234 --> 01:41:08,062
Isn't that your phone number?

1250
01:41:08,105 --> 01:41:09,280
Is it?

1251
01:41:09,324 --> 01:41:11,761
I forget. I don't call
myself that often.

1252
01:41:11,804 --> 01:41:14,851
Well, just to make sure,
we had Loach here
give you a call.

1253
01:41:14,894 --> 01:41:16,418
What happened to your nose, Gittes?

1254
01:41:16,461 --> 01:41:18,681
Somebody slam a bedroom window on it?

1255
01:41:21,336 --> 01:41:23,207
Nope. Your wife got excited.

1256
01:41:23,251 --> 01:41:25,079
She crossed her legs a little too quick.

1257
01:41:25,122 --> 01:41:27,081
You understand what I mean, pal?

1258
01:41:27,907 --> 01:41:29,083
Loach.

1259
01:41:49,451 --> 01:41:51,235
They look familiar?

1260
01:41:52,454 --> 01:41:54,151
Yeah. I took them. So what?

1261
01:41:54,195 --> 01:41:55,935
How did she happen to have them?

1262
01:41:55,979 --> 01:41:57,241
Either you tell me or I guess.

1263
01:41:57,285 --> 01:41:59,243
I don't know the answer.

1264
01:41:59,939 --> 01:42:02,203
You must really
think I'm stupid,
don't you, Gittes?

1265
01:42:02,246 --> 01:42:03,813
I don't think about it that much,

1266
01:42:03,856 --> 01:42:06,903
but give me a day or two
and I'll get back to you.

1267
01:42:06,946 --> 01:42:08,165
Now I'd like to go home.

1268
01:42:08,209 --> 01:42:10,428
I want the other pictures, Gittes.

1269
01:42:10,472 --> 01:42:12,126
What pictures?

1270
01:42:12,952 --> 01:42:16,260
This broad hired you, not Evelyn Mulwray.

1271
01:42:16,304 --> 01:42:17,914
Yeah?
Yeah.

1272
01:42:19,002 --> 01:42:20,743
Somebody wanted to shake Mulwray down,

1273
01:42:20,786 --> 01:42:22,310
she hired you.

1274
01:42:22,353 --> 01:42:24,921
That's how come you found out
he was murdered.

1275
01:42:24,964 --> 01:42:26,227
I heard it was an accident.

1276
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:28,142
Come on, Gittes.

1277
01:42:28,185 --> 01:42:31,449
Who the hell do you think
you're dealing with,
a bunch of assholes?

1278
01:42:31,493 --> 01:42:33,930
Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

1279
01:42:36,019 --> 01:42:37,281
You were following him day and night.

1280
01:42:37,325 --> 01:42:38,978
You saw who killed him.

1281
01:42:39,022 --> 01:42:41,111
You even took pictures of it.

1282
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:42,721
It was Evelyn Mulwray,

1283
01:42:42,852 --> 01:42:45,811
and she's been paying you
off like a slot machine
ever since.

1284
01:42:45,855 --> 01:42:47,204
You accusing me of extortion?

1285
01:42:47,248 --> 01:42:48,466
Absolutely.

1286
01:42:48,510 --> 01:42:50,338
I don't think I need a day or two.

1287
01:42:50,381 --> 01:42:52,514
You're dumber than you think
I think you are.

1288
01:42:52,557 --> 01:42:54,168
Not only that,
but I wouldn't
extort a nickel

1289
01:42:54,211 --> 01:42:55,821
from my worst enemy, Escobar.

1290
01:42:55,865 --> 01:42:57,388
That's where I draw the line.

1291
01:42:57,432 --> 01:42:59,825
I want the rest of the pictures, Gittes.

1292
01:42:59,869 --> 01:43:01,479
We're talking about accessory
after the fact,

1293
01:43:01,523 --> 01:43:03,264
conspiracy, and extortion, minimum.

1294
01:43:03,307 --> 01:43:04,526
What do you think, Evelyn Mulwray

1295
01:43:04,569 --> 01:43:05,962
knocked off her husband in the ocean,

1296
01:43:06,005 --> 01:43:07,572
then dragged him up to a reservoir

1297
01:43:07,616 --> 01:43:10,316
because she thought
it would look more
like an accident?

1298
01:43:11,533 --> 01:43:13,099
Mulwray was murdered and moved

1299
01:43:13,143 --> 01:43:16,538
because somebody
didn't want his body
found in the ocean.

1300
01:43:16,581 --> 01:43:17,974
Why is that?

1301
01:43:18,017 --> 01:43:20,019
He found out they were
dumping water there.

1302
01:43:20,063 --> 01:43:22,979
That's what they were trying to cover up.

1303
01:43:23,936 --> 01:43:25,982
What the hell are you talking about?

1304
01:43:26,025 --> 01:43:27,984
Come on. I'll show you.

1305
01:43:29,072 --> 01:43:32,206
Come on, Lou.
You're in charge.
Make a decision.

1306
01:43:50,354 --> 01:43:52,226
It's too late.
Too late for what?

1307
01:43:52,269 --> 01:43:54,880
They only dump the water at night.

1308
01:43:56,491 --> 01:43:57,927
Reach anybody?

1309
01:43:57,970 --> 01:43:59,537
Yelburton.
He's the new chief.

1310
01:43:59,581 --> 01:44:01,235
Yeah, I know who he is.
Go on!

1311
01:44:01,278 --> 01:44:02,366
He says...

1312
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:04,020
I know what he says.

1313
01:44:04,063 --> 01:44:05,195
Shut up.

1314
01:44:06,283 --> 01:44:07,589
Go on!

1315
01:44:07,632 --> 01:44:09,417
Yelburton says there's
irrigation in the Valley,

1316
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:11,593
and there's always
a little run-off
after they do that.

1317
01:44:11,636 --> 01:44:13,203
And he says Gittes knows this,

1318
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:14,469
and he's been going around

1319
01:44:14,552 --> 01:44:18,034
making irresponsible
accusations all last week.

1320
01:44:18,077 --> 01:44:19,601
Lou, let's swear out
a warrant for her arrest.

1321
01:44:19,644 --> 01:44:21,559
What the hell are we waiting for?

1322
01:44:21,603 --> 01:44:23,474
He just made lieutenant.

1323
01:44:23,518 --> 01:44:26,260
Wants to hang on to his little gold bar.

1324
01:44:30,133 --> 01:44:32,570
Have your client
in my office
in two hours.

1325
01:44:32,614 --> 01:44:35,269
And remember, I don't have to let you go.

1326
01:44:35,312 --> 01:44:38,272
I've got you right now
for withholding evidence.

1327
01:44:39,447 --> 01:44:40,622
Loach?

1328
01:45:26,363 --> 01:45:28,322
Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

1329
01:45:30,019 --> 01:45:31,542
These her bags?

1330
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,242
Is she going on a trip?

1331
01:45:37,069 --> 01:45:40,029
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

1332
01:45:40,072 --> 01:45:41,291
Is she going on a vacation?

1333
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,293
Mrs. Mulwray no home.

1334
01:45:43,772 --> 01:45:47,993
"Mrs. Mulwray no home."
Well, I'll just have
a look around, huh?

1335
01:45:55,087 --> 01:45:57,089
Yeah, yeah.
Bad for the glass.

1336
01:45:57,133 --> 01:45:59,396
Oh, yes. Bad for glass.

1337
01:46:00,049 --> 01:46:02,268
Salt water very bad for glass.

1338
01:46:18,067 --> 01:46:19,373
Salt water?

1339
01:46:20,069 --> 01:46:22,724
Very, very bad. See?

1340
01:46:31,646 --> 01:46:33,212
What's that?

1341
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,390
Right there.

1342
01:46:40,219 --> 01:46:41,395
There.

1343
01:47:39,235 --> 01:47:41,150
You wait.
You wait.

1344
01:47:46,634 --> 01:47:49,114
How are you?
I've been calling you.

1345
01:47:49,158 --> 01:47:50,464
Yeah?
It's all right, Kahn.

1346
01:47:50,507 --> 01:47:51,682
Have you slept?

1347
01:47:51,726 --> 01:47:52,814
Sure.

1348
01:47:54,119 --> 01:47:56,252
Have you had lunch?
Kahn can fix you something.

1349
01:47:56,295 --> 01:47:58,080
Where's the girl?

1350
01:47:58,123 --> 01:47:59,560
Upstairs. Why?

1351
01:47:59,603 --> 01:48:01,387
I want to see her.

1352
01:48:01,649 --> 01:48:03,564
She's having a bath right now.

1353
01:48:03,607 --> 01:48:05,696
Why do you want to see her?

1354
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:07,481
Going someplace?

1355
01:48:08,438 --> 01:48:11,180
Yes. We have
a 5:30 train to catch.

1356
01:48:14,836 --> 01:48:16,272
Jake?

1357
01:48:25,673 --> 01:48:28,371
J.J. Gittes for
Lieutenant Escobar.

1358
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:31,505
But... Now look,
what's the matter?
What's wrong?

1359
01:48:31,548 --> 01:48:32,636
I told you,
we have a 5:30...

1360
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:35,160
You're going to miss your train.

1361
01:48:36,205 --> 01:48:37,467
Lieutenant Escobar.

1362
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:38,599
Lou?
Yeah.

1363
01:48:38,642 --> 01:48:41,427
Meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive.

1364
01:48:43,212 --> 01:48:45,301
Yeah. Soon as you can.

1365
01:48:46,215 --> 01:48:47,912
Why did you do that?

1366
01:48:48,391 --> 01:48:50,480
You know any good criminal lawyers?

1367
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:51,786
No.

1368
01:48:53,265 --> 01:48:55,877
Don't worry, I can recommend a couple.

1369
01:48:56,573 --> 01:48:59,489
They're expensive, but you can afford it.

1370
01:49:00,272 --> 01:49:03,493
Will you please tell me
what this is all about?

1371
01:49:15,418 --> 01:49:18,377
I found these
in your backyard
in the pond.

1372
01:49:19,596 --> 01:49:22,338
They belonged
to your husband,
didn't they?

1373
01:49:22,381 --> 01:49:23,774
Didn't they?

1374
01:49:24,688 --> 01:49:26,472
I don't know. Yes, probably.

1375
01:49:26,516 --> 01:49:27,909
Yes, positively.

1376
01:49:27,952 --> 01:49:30,259
It's where he was drowned.

1377
01:49:30,302 --> 01:49:31,565
What?

1378
01:49:31,608 --> 01:49:34,263
There's no time
to be shocked by the truth.

1379
01:49:34,306 --> 01:49:35,786
The coroner's report proves

1380
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:38,267
that he had salt
water in his lungs
when he was killed.

1381
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:39,925
Just take my word for it, all right?

1382
01:49:40,008 --> 01:49:41,792
Now, I want to know
how it happened, and
I want to know why,

1383
01:49:41,836 --> 01:49:43,925
and I want to know
before Escobar gets here,

1384
01:49:43,968 --> 01:49:45,927
because I don't want to lose my license.

1385
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:47,929
I don't know what you are talking about.

1386
01:49:47,972 --> 01:49:50,235
This is the craziest, most insane thing...

1387
01:49:50,279 --> 01:49:51,759
Stop it!

1388
01:49:51,802 --> 01:49:53,630
I'm gonna make it easy for you.

1389
01:49:53,674 --> 01:49:54,936
You were jealous.
You had a fight.

1390
01:49:54,979 --> 01:49:56,502
He fell. He hit his head.

1391
01:49:56,546 --> 01:49:57,895
It was an accident!

1392
01:49:58,026 --> 01:50:00,419
But his girl is a witness.
So you had to shut her up.

1393
01:50:00,463 --> 01:50:01,682
You don't have the guts to harm her,

1394
01:50:01,725 --> 01:50:03,553
but you got the money
to keep her mouth shut.

1395
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:05,294
Yes or no?
No!

1396
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,906
Who is she? And don't give me
that crap about your sister,

1397
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:11,213
because you don't have a sister.

1398
01:50:11,256 --> 01:50:12,780
I'll tell you...

1399
01:50:13,302 --> 01:50:15,304
I'll tell you the truth.

1400
01:50:17,262 --> 01:50:18,960
Good. What's her name?

1401
01:50:20,875 --> 01:50:22,398
Katherine.

1402
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:23,834
Katherine who?

1403
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:27,838
She's my daughter.

1404
01:50:29,013 --> 01:50:30,972
I said I want the truth!

1405
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,452
She's my sister.

1406
01:50:34,758 --> 01:50:36,455
She's my daughter.

1407
01:50:37,456 --> 01:50:39,458
My sister, my daughter!

1408
01:50:40,329 --> 01:50:41,765
I said I want the truth!

1409
01:50:41,809 --> 01:50:42,984
All of it!

1410
01:50:45,769 --> 01:50:48,642
She's my sister and my daughter!

1411
01:50:52,602 --> 01:50:54,473
Kahn, please, go back.

1412
01:50:54,909 --> 01:50:57,476
For God's sake,
keep her upstairs.
Go back!

1413
01:51:04,919 --> 01:51:06,747
My father and I...

1414
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,709
Understand?

1415
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:15,756
Or is it too tough for you?

1416
01:51:24,895 --> 01:51:26,505
He raped you?

1417
01:51:43,348 --> 01:51:44,915
Then what happened?

1418
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:46,700
I ran away.

1419
01:51:46,961 --> 01:51:48,527
To Mexico.

1420
01:51:54,925 --> 01:51:58,407
Hollis came and took care of me.

1421
01:52:01,453 --> 01:52:03,107
I couldn't see her.

1422
01:52:04,456 --> 01:52:05,806
I was 15.

1423
01:52:09,548 --> 01:52:11,550
I wanted to, but I...

1424
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:14,031
I couldn't.

1425
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:17,861
Then...

1426
01:52:20,690 --> 01:52:22,779
Now I want to be with her.

1427
01:52:23,606 --> 01:52:25,739
I want to take care of her.

1428
01:52:26,043 --> 01:52:28,393
Where are you going to take her now?

1429
01:52:28,437 --> 01:52:29,917
Back to Mexico.

1430
01:52:31,179 --> 01:52:32,920
Well, you can't take the train.

1431
01:52:32,963 --> 01:52:35,966
Escobar will be looking
for you everywhere.

1432
01:52:38,534 --> 01:52:43,452
Well, how about a plane?

1433
01:52:43,495 --> 01:52:44,714
No, that's worse.

1434
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:45,976
You better just get out of here.

1435
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:48,109
Leave all this stuff here.

1436
01:52:48,152 --> 01:52:51,982
Where does Kahn live?
Get the exact address.

1437
01:52:52,896 --> 01:52:54,158
All right.

1438
01:52:57,901 --> 01:53:01,165
Those didn't belong to Hollis.

1439
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:03,472
How do you know?

1440
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:05,779
He didn't wear bifocals.

1441
01:53:37,201 --> 01:53:40,944
Katherine,
say hello to Mr. Gittes.

1442
01:53:41,162 --> 01:53:42,554
Hello.

1443
01:53:43,512 --> 01:53:44,643
Hello.

1444
01:53:49,692 --> 01:53:53,043
He lives at 1712 Alameda.
Do you know where that is?

1445
01:53:56,133 --> 01:53:57,221
Sure.

1446
01:54:18,286 --> 01:54:20,201
J.J. Gittes and Associates.

1447
01:54:20,244 --> 01:54:21,637
Sophie, get me Walsh.

1448
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,073
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

1449
01:54:24,161 --> 01:54:25,989
Jake?
Yeah.

1450
01:54:26,033 --> 01:54:29,601
Listen, pal, Escobar's
going to try and book me
in about five minutes.

1451
01:54:29,645 --> 01:54:31,125
What? What the hell's
the matter? What...

1452
01:54:31,168 --> 01:54:33,214
Relax and I'll tell you.

1453
01:54:33,257 --> 01:54:35,607
Wait in the office for me about two hours.

1454
01:54:35,651 --> 01:54:40,090
If you don't hear
from me, you and Duffy
meet me at 1712 Alameda.

1455
01:54:41,004 --> 01:54:43,920
Jesus. That's in Chinatown, ain't it?

1456
01:54:43,964 --> 01:54:45,966
I know where it is.
Just do it.

1457
01:54:46,009 --> 01:54:48,098
1712 Alameda...

1458
01:55:16,866 --> 01:55:18,563
Come on in, Lou.

1459
01:55:19,869 --> 01:55:23,699
Looks like
we're both too late.
She flew the coop.

1460
01:55:29,009 --> 01:55:32,229
I don't suppose
you have any idea
where she went.

1461
01:55:32,273 --> 01:55:33,927
As a matter of fact, I do.

1462
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:35,450
Where?

1463
01:55:35,493 --> 01:55:38,105
Her maid's house.
I think she knows
something's up.

1464
01:55:38,148 --> 01:55:40,281
What's the maid's address?

1465
01:55:40,890 --> 01:55:42,848
She lives in Pedro.
I'll write it down.

1466
01:55:42,892 --> 01:55:45,851
No, no, no, Gittes.
You're going to show us.

1467
01:55:46,635 --> 01:55:47,941
What for?

1468
01:55:48,811 --> 01:55:50,944
Because if she ain't there,
you're going downtown,

1469
01:55:50,987 --> 01:55:54,121
and you're gonna stay there
until she does show up.

1470
01:55:54,817 --> 01:55:57,298
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

1471
01:55:58,821 --> 01:56:01,737
Tell us about it on the way to San Pedro.

1472
01:56:14,924 --> 01:56:16,273
Let's get the little lady.

1473
01:56:16,317 --> 01:56:18,754
Lou, can I ask you a favor?

1474
01:56:19,146 --> 01:56:22,018
I'd like to bring her out myself.

1475
01:56:22,062 --> 01:56:25,674
She's not armed or nothing.
She won't be a problem.

1476
01:56:25,717 --> 01:56:27,763
I just want a minute alone with her.

1477
01:56:27,806 --> 01:56:29,634
It would mean a lot to her.

1478
01:56:29,678 --> 01:56:30,984
And to me.

1479
01:56:35,727 --> 01:56:37,991
You never learn, do you, Jake?

1480
01:56:39,775 --> 01:56:41,124
I guess not.

1481
01:56:44,127 --> 01:56:45,781
Okay. But...

1482
01:56:47,739 --> 01:56:49,785
I'll give you three minutes.

1483
01:56:49,828 --> 01:56:51,308
Just three minutes.

1484
01:56:51,352 --> 01:56:53,093
Gee, thanks, Lou.

1485
01:57:09,196 --> 01:57:10,327
Yes?

1486
01:57:11,676 --> 01:57:12,851
Hello.

1487
01:57:13,809 --> 01:57:15,680
Mr. Gittes! Come in!

1488
01:57:15,724 --> 01:57:17,204
Well, this is some surprise,
Mr. Gittes.

1489
01:57:17,247 --> 01:57:19,206
Call me Jake.
How you doing, Curly?

1490
01:57:19,249 --> 01:57:21,251
Just sitting down for supper.
You care to join us?

1491
01:57:21,295 --> 01:57:22,687
No, thanks.

1492
01:57:22,731 --> 01:57:24,385
How about a glass of wine?

1493
01:57:24,428 --> 01:57:25,777
Hey, honey, this is the fellow that...

1494
01:57:25,821 --> 01:57:27,170
I know.

1495
01:57:27,214 --> 01:57:29,042
No, thank you, Curly, very much,

1496
01:57:29,085 --> 01:57:30,739
but I would like a glass of water, though.

1497
01:57:30,782 --> 01:57:32,784
Come on out in
the kitchen with me
for a second, huh?

1498
01:57:32,828 --> 01:57:34,047
Sure thing.

1499
01:57:38,138 --> 01:57:39,922
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.

1500
01:57:39,965 --> 01:57:41,184
Where's that?

1501
01:57:41,228 --> 01:57:42,359
Off the alley.

1502
01:57:42,403 --> 01:57:43,795
Can you give me a ride somewhere?

1503
01:57:43,839 --> 01:57:45,101
Sure, soon as we eat.

1504
01:57:45,145 --> 01:57:47,408
Right now, Curly.
It can't wait.

1505
01:57:47,973 --> 01:57:49,279
I'll tell my wife.

1506
01:57:49,323 --> 01:57:50,889
Tell her later, Curl, huh?

1507
01:58:22,965 --> 01:58:26,055
Just drive slow
for a block or two,
will you, Curly?

1508
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:28,231
What's this all about?

1509
01:58:28,275 --> 01:58:30,407
I'll tell you in a block or two.

1510
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:33,454
How much do you owe me?

1511
01:58:33,497 --> 01:58:36,805
Gee, Mr. Gittes,
we're going out tomorrow.

1512
01:58:36,848 --> 01:58:40,417
I know you been
real good about it,
but my cousin Auggie's sick.

1513
01:58:40,461 --> 01:58:42,419
Forget it. How would
you like to pay me off

1514
01:58:42,463 --> 01:58:45,814
by taking a couple of
passengers to Ensenada?

1515
01:58:45,857 --> 01:58:47,424
You'd have to leave tonight.

1516
01:58:47,468 --> 01:58:49,296
I don't know.

1517
01:58:49,339 --> 01:58:53,778
I might be able
to squeeze 75 bucks
out of it for you.

1518
01:58:54,475 --> 01:58:56,085
Maybe even 100.

1519
01:58:57,478 --> 01:58:58,783
Plus what I owe?

1520
01:58:58,827 --> 01:59:00,350
I'll throw that in, too.

1521
01:59:01,525 --> 01:59:03,919
1712 Alameda.
It's in Chinatown.

1522
01:59:03,962 --> 01:59:05,268
Wait for me until 8:30.

1523
01:59:05,312 --> 01:59:08,228
If I don't show up,
take them to your boat.

1524
01:59:21,328 --> 01:59:23,286
You sure this is okay?

1525
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:27,464
Curly, you know how long
I've been in this business?

1526
01:59:55,013 --> 01:59:59,104
Have you got your
checkbook handy,
Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

1527
02:00:00,149 --> 02:00:02,325
You've got her? Where?

1528
02:00:02,369 --> 02:00:04,501
Do you remember the figures we discussed?

1529
02:00:04,545 --> 02:00:06,982
Of course I do.
Where are you?

1530
02:00:07,025 --> 02:00:10,333
At your daughter's house.
How soon can you get here?

1531
02:00:10,377 --> 02:00:11,508
An hour.

1532
02:00:35,489 --> 02:00:37,491
Oh, there you are.

1533
02:00:37,534 --> 02:00:42,017
Well, you don't look
too much the worse for
wear, Mr. Gitts, I must say.

1534
02:00:42,365 --> 02:00:43,540
Where's the girl?

1535
02:00:43,584 --> 02:00:44,889
I've got her.

1536
02:00:44,933 --> 02:00:46,064
Is she all right?

1537
02:00:46,108 --> 02:00:47,240
She's fine.

1538
02:00:47,892 --> 02:00:49,503
Well, where is she?

1539
02:00:50,155 --> 02:00:51,896
With her mother.

1540
02:00:53,594 --> 02:00:56,858
I got something
I'd like to show you,
Mr. Cross.

1541
02:00:56,901 --> 02:00:58,076
What is it?

1542
02:00:58,120 --> 02:00:59,426
An obituary column.

1543
02:00:59,469 --> 02:01:01,645
Can you see all right in this light?

1544
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,517
I guess I can manage.

1545
02:01:13,353 --> 02:01:15,093
What does it mean?

1546
02:01:15,137 --> 02:01:17,400
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

1547
02:01:18,401 --> 02:01:19,924
Right here,

1548
02:01:20,142 --> 02:01:21,578
in that pond.

1549
02:01:22,318 --> 02:01:24,059
You drowned him.

1550
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:27,105
And you left these.

1551
02:01:29,325 --> 02:01:33,329
The coroner's report
shows Mulwray had
salt water in his lungs.

1552
02:01:37,028 --> 02:01:41,163
Hollis was always
fascinated by tide pools.

1553
02:01:42,164 --> 02:01:44,253
You know what he used to say?

1554
02:01:44,297 --> 02:01:45,994
I haven't the faintest idea.

1555
02:01:46,037 --> 02:01:48,083
"That's where life begins."

1556
02:01:48,126 --> 02:01:50,085
Sloughs, tide pools.

1557
02:01:51,565 --> 02:01:52,914
When we first come out here,

1558
02:01:52,957 --> 02:01:55,612
he figured if
you dumped water
into desert sand

1559
02:01:55,656 --> 02:01:59,660
and let it percolate
down to the bedrock,
it would stay there

1560
02:01:59,703 --> 02:02:02,967
instead of evaporate
the way it does
in most reservoirs.

1561
02:02:03,011 --> 02:02:06,580
You'd only lose 20%
instead of 70 or 80.
He made this city.

1562
02:02:06,623 --> 02:02:08,451
And that's what
you were going to
do in the Valley.

1563
02:02:08,495 --> 02:02:10,018
It's what I am doing.

1564
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:12,107
When the bond issue passes Tuesday,

1565
02:02:12,150 --> 02:02:14,327
there'll be $8 million
to build an aqueduct
and a reservoir.

1566
02:02:14,370 --> 02:02:15,980
I'm doing it.

1567
02:02:16,024 --> 02:02:17,504
Gonna be a lot of irate citizens

1568
02:02:17,547 --> 02:02:19,332
when they find out that they're paying

1569
02:02:19,375 --> 02:02:21,029
for water that they're not gonna get.

1570
02:02:21,072 --> 02:02:23,118
Oh, that's all taken care of.

1571
02:02:23,161 --> 02:02:27,252
See, Mr. Gitts,
either you bring
the water to L.A.,

1572
02:02:27,296 --> 02:02:29,472
or you bring L.A.
to the water.

1573
02:02:30,255 --> 02:02:31,474
How are you gonna do that?

1574
02:02:31,518 --> 02:02:33,346
By incorporating the Valley into the city.

1575
02:02:33,389 --> 02:02:35,260
Simple as that.

1576
02:02:37,001 --> 02:02:38,133
How much are you worth?

1577
02:02:38,176 --> 02:02:39,308
I have no idea.

1578
02:02:39,352 --> 02:02:40,875
How much do you want?

1579
02:02:41,005 --> 02:02:43,094
No, I just want to know
what you're worth.
Over $10 million?

1580
02:02:43,138 --> 02:02:44,357
Oh my, yes.

1581
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,141
Why are you doing it?

1582
02:02:46,184 --> 02:02:47,451
How much better can you eat?

1583
02:02:47,534 --> 02:02:49,666
What can you buy
that you can't
already afford?

1584
02:02:49,710 --> 02:02:51,494
The future, Mr. Gitts!

1585
02:02:52,147 --> 02:02:53,409
The future!

1586
02:02:54,279 --> 02:02:56,281
Now, where's the girl?

1587
02:02:56,325 --> 02:02:58,588
I want the only daughter I've got left.

1588
02:02:58,632 --> 02:03:02,026
As you found out,
Evelyn was lost to me
a long time ago.

1589
02:03:02,070 --> 02:03:04,333
Who do you blame for that?
Her?

1590
02:03:04,768 --> 02:03:06,596
I don't blame myself.

1591
02:03:08,076 --> 02:03:11,384
See, Mr. Gitts, most people
never have to face the fact

1592
02:03:11,427 --> 02:03:14,082
that at the right time
and the right place,

1593
02:03:14,125 --> 02:03:16,301
they're capable of anything.

1594
02:03:18,478 --> 02:03:21,611
Claude, take those glasses
from him, will you?

1595
02:03:28,792 --> 02:03:31,229
It's not worth it,
Mr. Gitts.

1596
02:03:33,188 --> 02:03:35,233
It's really not worth it.

1597
02:03:41,762 --> 02:03:43,067
Where's the girl?

1598
02:04:37,948 --> 02:04:41,256
You remember "Night Train"
Claude Mulvihill,
don't you, boys?

1599
02:04:41,299 --> 02:04:44,651
Mr. Cross,
these are my associates,
Mr. Walsh and Mr...

1600
02:04:45,913 --> 02:04:48,219
You're under arrest, Jake.

1601
02:04:50,308 --> 02:04:51,962
Good news.

1602
02:04:52,006 --> 02:04:55,270
Withholding evidence,
extortion, accessory
after the fact.

1603
02:04:55,313 --> 02:04:57,577
I didn't extort nothing from nobody, Lou.

1604
02:04:57,620 --> 02:04:59,274
This is Noah Cross, if you don't know.

1605
02:04:59,317 --> 02:05:00,797
Evelyn's father, if you don't know.

1606
02:05:00,841 --> 02:05:02,233
He's the bird you're after, Lou.

1607
02:05:02,277 --> 02:05:03,365
I can explain everything.

1608
02:05:03,408 --> 02:05:04,453
Lieutenant?
Just give me five minutes.

1609
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:05,628
That's all I need.

1610
02:05:05,672 --> 02:05:07,804
He's rich!
Do you understand?
Shut up!

1611
02:05:07,848 --> 02:05:10,241
He thinks he can get away with anything!

1612
02:05:10,285 --> 02:05:12,505
Shut up or
I'm gonna lock you in
to the wheel of that car.

1613
02:05:12,548 --> 02:05:16,334
Lieutenant, I am rich, I am Noah Cross.

1614
02:05:16,857 --> 02:05:18,206
Evelyn Mulwray is my daughter.

1615
02:05:18,249 --> 02:05:19,512
He's crazy, Lou!

1616
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:21,165
He killed Mulwray
because of the water thing!

1617
02:05:21,209 --> 02:05:22,427
I'm telling...
Water?

1618
02:05:22,515 --> 02:05:23,998
Would you just listen to me
for five minutes?

1619
02:05:24,081 --> 02:05:26,431
Loach, lock him to the wheel of that car.

1620
02:05:27,432 --> 02:05:30,305
Lou, you don't know
what's going on here.
I'm telling you.

1621
02:05:30,348 --> 02:05:31,828
Katherine!

1622
02:05:31,872 --> 02:05:33,264
Katherine.

1623
02:05:33,308 --> 02:05:36,137
I am your grandfather, my dear.

1624
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:38,226
Come, miss.

1625
02:05:38,269 --> 02:05:39,836
I'm your grandfather.
Come, miss.

1626
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:41,664
Katherine, get in the car.

1627
02:05:41,708 --> 02:05:43,231
Go on, go on.
But, ma'am...

1628
02:05:43,274 --> 02:05:44,711
No, no, go back to the Hong Kong.

1629
02:05:44,754 --> 02:05:46,364
I'll follow.
It's all right.

1630
02:05:47,278 --> 02:05:49,367
Get away from her. Get away!

1631
02:05:49,411 --> 02:05:54,242
Evelyn. Please, please,
be reasonable.

1632
02:05:54,285 --> 02:05:55,460
Come to my...

1633
02:05:55,504 --> 02:05:56,679
Get away from her!

1634
02:05:56,723 --> 02:05:57,941
Evelyn!

1635
02:05:59,334 --> 02:06:02,206
How many years have I got?

1636
02:06:02,685 --> 02:06:04,382
She's mine, too.

1637
02:06:04,426 --> 02:06:06,689
She's never going to know that!

1638
02:06:08,909 --> 02:06:11,346
Evelyn, you're a disturbed woman.

1639
02:06:11,389 --> 02:06:13,348
You cannot hope to provide.

1640
02:06:13,391 --> 02:06:16,177
Evelyn, put that gun away!
Let the police handle this!

1641
02:06:16,220 --> 02:06:17,874
He owns the police!

1642
02:06:18,745 --> 02:06:20,442
Get away from her.

1643
02:06:20,485 --> 02:06:21,574
You'll have to kill me first.

1644
02:06:21,617 --> 02:06:22,705
Get away! Get...

1645
02:06:24,794 --> 02:06:26,883
Katherine, close the door.

1646
02:06:27,492 --> 02:06:28,581
Halt!

1647
02:07:09,491 --> 02:07:10,927
Oh, no!

1648
02:07:10,971 --> 02:07:13,800
Better call the captain.
Get an ambulance.

1649
02:07:13,843 --> 02:07:15,802
No!
Turn him loose.
Turn them all loose.

1650
02:07:15,845 --> 02:07:17,368
Lord.
No!

1651
02:07:20,937 --> 02:07:22,417
Lord.

1652
02:07:22,765 --> 02:07:24,027
Lord.

1653
02:07:25,725 --> 02:07:27,291
No! No!

1654
02:07:28,989 --> 02:07:30,730
No! No! No! No! No!

1655
02:07:30,773 --> 02:07:32,732
Don't look. Don't look.
Don't look.

1656
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:46,833
As little as possible.

1657
02:07:46,876 --> 02:07:48,312
What's that?

1658
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:52,752
What's that?

1659
02:07:57,408 --> 02:08:00,324
You want to do your partner a big favor?

1660
02:08:01,848 --> 02:08:03,458
Take him home.

1661
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:08,593
Take him home!

1662
02:08:08,811 --> 02:08:11,466
Just get him the hell out of here!

1663
02:08:11,509 --> 02:08:12,902
Come on, Jake.

1664
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:15,600
Go home, Jake.

1665
02:08:16,601 --> 02:08:18,647
I'm doing you a favor.

1666
02:08:20,083 --> 02:08:21,694
Come on, Jake.

1667
02:08:24,827 --> 02:08:27,351
Forget it, Jake.
It's Chinatown.

1668
02:08:42,105 --> 02:08:45,979
All right, come on.
Clear the area!
On the sidewalk!

1669
02:08:47,894 --> 02:08:49,722
On the sidewalk!

1670
02:08:51,767 --> 02:08:53,595
Get off the street!

1671
02:08:55,902 --> 02:08:57,730
Get off the street!

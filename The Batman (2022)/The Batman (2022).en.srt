1
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,755
Hey!

2
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,450
<i>A dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

3
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,453
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

4
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,079
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

5
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,506
<i>Just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

6
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:14,423
<i>And 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

7
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,011
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

8
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,553
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

9
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,679
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

10
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,521
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

11
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,346
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

12
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,959
<i>and the safety net for those who need it.</i>

13
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,147
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

14
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,025
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

15
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,551
<i>Murder and drug use are at historic highs.</i>

16
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,493
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

17
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,826
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

18
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:42,955
<i>Under my administration,</i>

19
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,827
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

20
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,410
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

21
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,791
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

22
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,881
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

23
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,276
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

24
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,319
<i>But listen...</i>

25
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,820
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

26
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,300
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

27
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:04,809
Hey.

28
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,977
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

29
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,855
Why is she still tied?

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,442
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

31
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,956
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

32
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,912
Just call me in the morning, okay?

33
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,613
<i>Who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

34
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,174
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

35
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,927
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

36
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,713
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

37
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,312
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

38
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,154
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

39
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,124
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

40
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,126
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

41
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,121
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

42
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,882
<i>Watching.</i>

43
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,885
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

44
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,060
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

45
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,683
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

46
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,324
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

47
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,908
<i>It's a big city.</i>

48
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,256
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

49
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,764
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

50
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,684
Look at this guy, man.

51
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,034
Boom!

52
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,195
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

53
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,851
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

54
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,475
Yo, let's see your hits.

55
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,492
That's you.

56
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,896
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

57
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,854
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

58
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,732
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

59
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,864
<i>It's a warning.</i>

60
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,665
<i>To them.</i>

61
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,590
<i>Fear...</i>

62
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,716
<i>is a tool.</i>

63
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,981
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!

64
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,370
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

65
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,338
Come on!

66
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,675
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

67
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,612
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

68
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,557
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

69
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,381
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

70
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,240
Help!

71
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,540
Somebody help me!

72
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,327
Help, help!

73
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,614
Where you goin', huh?

74
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,226
Come on.

75
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,930
Come on, man. Break it.

76
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,517
You can't move, huh?

77
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,607
Now knock his ass out.

78
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,400
Showtime. Showtime, man.

79
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,026
Come on, man.

80
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,353
Come on. Do it, man.

81
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,307
You see this guy?

82
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,150
The hell are you supposed to be?

83
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,463
I'm vengeance.

84
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,507
Holy shit. It's him.

85
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,322
Hey, man. No, no, no!

86
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,448
Please don't hurt me.

87
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,078
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

88
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,868
Police action.

89
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,120
He's with me, Officer.

90
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,962
Are you kidding me, sir?

91
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,623
You're gonna let him in here?

92
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,089
Martinez, let him through.

93
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,475
Goddamn freak.

94
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,458
What do we know?

95
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,671
Detective?

96
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,381
Sorry, Lieutenant.

97
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:34,762
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

98
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,686
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

99
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,479
All this blood is from his head?

100
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,948
No.

101
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,493
Excuse me.

102
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,656
Most of it's from his hand.

103
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,166
Thumb was severed.

104
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,007
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

105
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,297
He was alive when it was cut off.

106
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,009
Ecchymosis...

107
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,803
around the wound.

108
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,741
Security detail downstairs

109
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,034
said the family was out trick-or-treatin'.

110
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,746
The mayor was up here alone.

111
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,877
Killer may have come through the skylight.

112
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,047
You said there was a card.

113
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,720
Yeah.

114
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,896
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

115
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,903
Haven't a clue?

116
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,356
Let's play a game, just me and you.

117
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,947
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

118
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,370
There's a cipher too.

119
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,997
Any of this mean anything to you?

120
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,758
What's going on here?

121
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,259
I asked him to come, Pete.

122
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,010
This is a crime scene.

123
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,433
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

124
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,511
I got the press downstairs.

125
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,359
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

126
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,274
But this is way over the line.

127
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,028
Wait.

128
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,884
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

129
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,023
How do you know?

130
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,110
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

131
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,015
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

132
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,725
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

133
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,285
He lies still.

134
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,794
Excuse me?

135
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,419
The riddle.

136
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,420
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

137
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,051
Oh, Jesus.

138
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,104
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

139
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,943
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

140
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,355
Excuse me, Commissioner.

141
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,111
They're ready for your statement.

142
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,871
I want him outta here.

143
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,581
Now!

144
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,380
Come on.

145
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,394
Yeah.

146
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,060
The kid found him.

147
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,064
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

148
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,670
We really gotta go, man.

149
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,975
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

150
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,268
A wife lost a husband.

151
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,017
And I lost a friend.

152
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,646
Mayor Mitchell was a fighter for the city,

153
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,819
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

154
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,444
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

155
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,614
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

156
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,790
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

157
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,127
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

158
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,043
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

159
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,712
<i>but I don't know.</i>

160
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,504
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

161
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,681
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

162
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,766
<i>And now this.</i>

163
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,520
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

164
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,484
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

165
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,858
<i>But I have to try.</i>

166
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,897
<i>Push myself.</i>

167
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,488
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

168
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,369
<i>behind the mask.</i>

169
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,168
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

170
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,130
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

171
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,097
<i>everything that happened.</i>

172
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,300
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

173
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,192
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

174
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,119
<i>Was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

175
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,958
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

176
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,702
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

177
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,283
<i>still have not been released,</i>

178
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,245
<i>but a citywide manhunt is already underway</i>

179
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,582
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

180
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,511
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

181
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,139
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

182
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:27,466
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

183
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,312
<i>that celebrated billionaire philanthropist</i>

184
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,352
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

185
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,272
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

186
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:38,192
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

187
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,073
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

188
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,818
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

189
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,151
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

190
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,204
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

191
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,455
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

192
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,045
I assume you heard about this.

193
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,120
Yeah.

194
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,429
Oh, I see.

195
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,227
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

196
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,934
Dear God.

197
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,733
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

198
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,035
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

199
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,012
The killer left this for the Batman?

200
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,084
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

201
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,175
Apparently.

202
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,334
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

203
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,719
Why is he writing to you?

204
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,247
<i>It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!</i>

205
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,343
I don't know yet.

206
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,970
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

207
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,265
Have a shower.

208
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,412
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

209
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,402
are coming for breakfast.

210
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,476
Here? Why?

211
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,714
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

212
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,858
I haven't got time for this.

213
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,567
It's getting serious, Bruce.

214
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,745
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

215
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,410
I don't care about that.

216
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,195
Any of that.

217
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,389
You don't care about your family's legacy?

218
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,286
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

219
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,542
If I can't change things here,

220
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,002
if I can't have an effect,

221
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,721
then I don't care what happens to me.

222
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:27,930
That's what I'm afraid of.

223
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,629
Alfred, stop.

224
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,472
You're not my father.

225
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,682
I'm well aware.

226
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,256
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

227
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,500
Some fresh berries there.

228
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,791
What are you doing?

229
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,842
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

230
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:57,137
This is actually quite elusive.

231
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,808
Where'd you get those O's?

232
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,147
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

233
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,648
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

234
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:12,778
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

235
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,233
see where it leads.

236
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,163
That's interesting.

237
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,530
Mr. Pennyworth?

238
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:20,917
Yes, Dory?

239
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,707
The accountants are here.

240
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,627
See them in, please, Dory.

241
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,756
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

242
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,425
What do you mean?

243
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,344
What if this is the whole key?

244
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,801
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

245
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,995
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

246
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,187
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

247
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,398
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

248
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,313
I don't see how that's gonna...

249
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
Oh.

250
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,328
Damn.

251
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,743
Yeah, he's got a car.

252
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,039
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

253
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,794
Where to even start?

254
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,721
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

255
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,924
You don't trust me?

256
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,422
You mean like you trust me?

257
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,666
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

258
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,511
There.

259
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,914
What are we looking for?

260
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,083
A USB port.

261
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,289
USB?

262
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,551
What?

263
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,179
"Thumb" drive.

264
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,599
Jesus.

265
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,728
It's encrypted.

266
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,446
Try this.

267
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,827
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

268
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,304
Oh, well, well, well.

269
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,965
So much for family values.

270
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,304
Who is she?

271
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,976
No idea.

272
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,730
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

273
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,867
I know who he is.

274
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,027
What was that?

275
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,613
Shit, shit! The drive.

276
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,699
It sent out the photos from my account.

277
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,323
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

278
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,495
Jesus.

279
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

280
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,499
"He lies still."

281
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,746
About her?

282
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,587
Maybe.

283
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,623
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

284
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,130
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

285
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,337
Never get in there without a warrant.

286
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,765
Yeah.

287
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,071
Know who I am?

288
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,650
Yeah. I got an idea.

289
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,531
I want to see the Penguin.

290
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,488
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

291
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
What's the problem?

292
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,382
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

293
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,627
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

294
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,334
That's what I tried to tell him.

295
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,715
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

296
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,255
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

297
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,139
Mine or yours?

298
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,484
Get him!

299
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,754
I saw that whole thing.

300
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,984
He's over there!

301
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,402
What is your problem?

302
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,524
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

303
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,247
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

304
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,496
Take it easy, sweetheart.

305
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,376
You looking for me?

306
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,004
I see you met the twins.

307
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,259
Boy, you're everything they say, ain't ya?

308
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,631
I guess we both are.

309
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,098
How you doing?

310
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,141
I'm Oz.

311
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,936
Who is she?

312
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,903
I really don't know, chief.

313
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,830
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

314
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,463
but I wasn't rolling with them.

315
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
It's okay, baby.

316
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:10,052
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

317
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,998
Thank you, honey.

318
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,340
Here you go, champ.

319
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:48,965
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

320
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,842
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

321
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,715
Is that the mayor?

322
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,595
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

323
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,098
Don't make me hurt you.

324
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:01,353
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

325
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:04,401
Yeah, I do. Do you?

326
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,646
Look...

327
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,697
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

328
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,826
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

329
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,757
Tell you one thing.

330
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,513
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

331
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,516
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

332
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,604
What? Too soon?

333
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,900
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

334
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,129
Taxi!

335
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,632
Taxi!

336
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,688
Hey, it's me.

337
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,319
Baby, what's wrong?

338
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

339
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,864
On the news?

340
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,826
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

341
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,623
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

342
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,412
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

343
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,749
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

344
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,117
Uh...

345
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,386
God damn it.

346
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,430
<i>Photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

347
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,320
<i>With a younger mystery woman.</i>

348
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,864
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

349
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,613
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

350
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,569
You're pretty good at that.

351
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,202
Hey! Give me that.

352
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,372
"Kosolov, Annika."

353
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,962
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

354
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,791
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

355
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,499
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

356
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,051
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

357
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,573
She's trying to get the hell out of here,

358
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,349
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

359
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,797
What does she know?

360
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,078
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

361
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,684
She did seem upset.

362
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,971
Back at your place.

363
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,516
Let's go talk to her.

364
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,801
Anni!

365
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,178
Baby!

366
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:31,848
Anni!

367
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,137
Anni!

368
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,045
<i>It's gonna be cool this evening.</i>

369
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,276
<i>It's gonna be down into the 40s.</i>

370
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,299
<i>More breaking news this hour</i>

371
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:50,693
<i>as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.</i>

372
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,140
<i>And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...</i>

373
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,997
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

374
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,618
Shit, they took my phone.

375
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,148
<i>His victim, longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,</i>

376
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,583
<i>Commissioner Pete Savage,</i>

378
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,096
<i>inside the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricorner area.</i>

379
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,513
<i>The killer posted the following message
on social media,</i>

380
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,466
<i>and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.</i>

381
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,274
<i>Hello, people of Gotham.</i>

382
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,317
<i>This is the Riddler speaking.</i>

383
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,438
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

384
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:32,322
<i>I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.</i>

385
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,449
<i>But I am not done.</i>

386
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,787
<i>Here is another...</i>

387
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,087
<i>who will soon be losing face.</i>

388
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:52,638
<i>I will kill again, and again, and again,</i>

389
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,556
<i>until our day of judgment</i>

390
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:59,637
<i>when the truth about our city
will finally...</i>

391
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,431
<i>be unmasked.</i>

392
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,768
<i>Goodbye!</i>

393
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,719
<i>Commissioner Savage served a distinguished</i>

394
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,859
<i>30-year career on the GCPD...</i>

395
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,160
<i>Holy shit, I seen that guy too.</i>

396
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,540
At the club.

397
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,620
The Iceberg Lounge?

398
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,834
44 Below.

399
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,757
What is that?

400
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,547
The club within the club.

401
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,550
The real club.

402
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,592
It's a mob hangout.

403
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,473
Is that where you work?

404
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,398
Selina?

405
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,979
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

406
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,988
But I see 'em come in.

407
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,285
Who?

408
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,772
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

409
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,538
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

410
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,334
You're gonna help me on this.

411
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,457
For your friend.

412
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,393
You got a lot of cats.

413
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,809
I have a thing about strays.

414
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,277
You're not safe here.

415
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,575
I can take care of myself.

416
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,446
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

417
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,079
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

418
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,405
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

419
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,332
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

420
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,516
He waited for him at the gym.

421
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,693
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

422
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,892
when no one else was around.

423
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,448
There's a needle mark on his neck.

424
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,488
Injected him with arsenic.

425
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,824
Rat poison.

426
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,202
Yeah.

427
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,830
That seems to be his theme here.

428
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,740
Look at this thing.

429
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,626
It's a maze.

430
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,510
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

431
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,351
More symbols.

432
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,439
It's another cipher.

433
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,267
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

434
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,528
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

435
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,733
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

436
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,659
I don't get it.

437
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,246
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

438
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,032
Looks like he got greedy.

439
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,161
You kidding me?

440
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,960
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

441
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:14,300
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

442
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,590
Maybe he's not who you thought.

443
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,174
You make it sound like he had it coming.

444
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,889
He was a cop.

445
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,514
Crossed a line.

446
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,421
"I'm mad about you.

447
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:03,176
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

448
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,397
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

449
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:17,152
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

450
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,945
The hell is that?

451
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,862
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

452
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,485
I don't know.

453
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,533
Lieutenant.

454
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,034
They're coming back.

455
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,525
We got to get out of here.

456
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,669
Come on.

457
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,796
Ow!

458
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,599
I don't know about these things.

459
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,141
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

460
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,748
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

461
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,067
I'm just looking for Annika.

462
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,982
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

463
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,369
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

464
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,504
Look at me.

465
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,304
Looks good. Here.

466
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,470
I got you. Can you hear me?

467
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,440
Yeah.

468
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,167
Hey, where you goin'?

469
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:28,858
Hospitality.

470
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,470
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

471
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,740
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

472
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,507
"Kenzie, William."

473
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,049
He's an off-duty cop.

474
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,908
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

475
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,969
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

476
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,652
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

477
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:12,861
Great.

478
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,482
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

479
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,088
Feels good, doesn't it?

480
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,382
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

481
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,049
<i>Jesus, I hate dropheads.</i>

482
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,178
Really?

483
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,288
'Cause when I first saw you,

484
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,581
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

485
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,305
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

486
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,224
Can we not do this right now?

487
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,689
Wait. Who was that?

488
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,941
Oh, I saw him.

489
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,112
<i>Look back.</i>

490
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,052
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

491
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,407
I need to see his face.

492
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,535
Jesus.

493
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,707
That's the DA.

494
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:04,833
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

495
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,585
And he's coming over. You happy?

496
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:07,881
<i>Talk to him.</i>

497
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,094
Hey. How you doing?

498
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:13,262
Hi.

499
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,349
I'm Gil.

500
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,009
Hey, aren't you the DA?

501
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,103
Yeah.

502
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,432
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

503
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:21,888
Is that right?

504
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,523
I haven't seen you around here before.

505
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,572
It's a hell of a time to be the new girl,

506
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,192
'cause people are all a little on edge.

507
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,842
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

508
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,136
<i>Is that right?</i>

509
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,366
<i>I like that.</i>

510
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,788
Do you want to come over?

511
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,986
Sure.

512
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,331
<i>- This is Travis.
- Hey.</i>

513
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,046
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

514
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,995
<i>- Richie, Glen.
- Hey.</i>

515
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,955
That's half the DA's office.

516
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,277
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

517
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,301
Hi.

518
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,447
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

519
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,337
Drowning our sorrows.

520
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,968
<i>You want a drop?</i>

521
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,095
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

522
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,723
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

523
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:04,233
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

524
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,316
He's wasted.

525
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,394
No shit.

526
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,190
<i>I like this girl.</i>

527
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,112
<i>Oh, hey, I like you too!</i>

528
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,997
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

529
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,161
<i>He knows so much.</i>

530
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,600
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

531
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,936
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

532
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,878
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

533
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,939
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

534
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,920
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

535
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,757
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

536
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,310
<i>I mean...</i>

537
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,732
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

538
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,731
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

539
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,591
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

540
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,200
He's talking about the Maroni case.

541
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:57,571
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

542
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,456
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

543
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,450
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

544
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,228
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

545
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,652
What do you know about that?

546
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,298
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

547
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,381
<i>I want a drink.</i>

548
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:11,748
Keep him talking.

549
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,930
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

550
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,048
She knows Annika.

551
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,550
No, stay on the DA.

552
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,552
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

553
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,814
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

554
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:25,999
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

555
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,627
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

556
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:29,902
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

557
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,443
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

558
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,443
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

559
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,093
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

560
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,198
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

561
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:43,992
<i>Hey.</i>

562
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,664
Hey.

563
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,998
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

564
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,504
How you been?

565
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,550
Yeah, I've been okay.

566
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,253
<i>I was just...</i>

567
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,140
I was just headed back upstairs.

568
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,894
Well...

569
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,641
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

570
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,123
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

571
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,850
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

572
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,668
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

573
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,646
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

574
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,755
Wait, what are you doing?

575
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,250
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

576
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:38,845
Taxi!

577
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:43,808
Hey!

578
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,600
I lost you in there.

579
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:47,768
Yeah, I gotta go.

580
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,058
Oh, you need a ride?

581
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,060
That's me right there.

582
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,238
Taxi!

583
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,440
I'm good.

584
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:03,572
I hope, uh...

585
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,578
I'll see you around.

586
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:40,044
Just hold still.

587
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,318
What do you know about

588
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,688
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

589
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,489
Yeah, sure, there was.

590
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:49,033
That's the rat we're looking for.

591
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,819
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

592
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:55,406
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

593
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:56,957
Where are you getting this?

594
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,911
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

595
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,170
Gil's very nervous.

596
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,678
I think the Killer's targeting
people close to that case.

597
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,627
I worked that case.

598
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,678
Riddler's not after you.

599
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:10,765
How do you know?

600
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,469
You're not corrupt.

601
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:15,055
Colson's dirty?

602
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,433
Maybe I, uh...

603
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,445
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

604
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:29,820
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

605
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,371
Who knows how many people it touches.

606
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,663
Politicians. Police. The courts.

607
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,709
It could tear the whole city apart.

608
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,123
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

609
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,497
And Riddler's the match.

610
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:46,611
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

611
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:47,987
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

612
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,489
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

613
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,073
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

614
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,701
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

615
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,825
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

616
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,976
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

617
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,165
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

618
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,875
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

619
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,794
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

620
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,298
Pretty.

621
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,436
She a new friend of yours?

622
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,241
I'm not so sure.

623
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,569
Looks like you upset her.

624
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,864
Shall I take this as a good sign?

625
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:19,959
What?

626
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:20,953
Your attire.

627
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,160
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

628
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,257
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

629
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,090
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

630
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,638
Riddler might not be able to resist.

631
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,177
Oh, that reminds me.

632
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:37,307
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

633
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,343
The one from the rat maze.

634
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,854
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

635
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,069
but I'm fairly certain this translates to,

636
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:48,395
"You are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>"

637
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,442
<i>Rata Alada?</i>

638
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,738
"Rat with wings"?

639
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,328
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

640
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,651
Yeah.

641
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,237
A stool pigeon.

642
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,114
Where are your cuff links?

643
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,258
I couldn't find them.

644
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,585
Well, you can't go out like that.

645
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,521
Alfred, I don't want your cuff links.

646
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:13,424
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

647
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,347
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

648
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,138
Your father gave them to me.

649
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:29,019
No more lies! No more lies!

650
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:50,464
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

651
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,470
Is that Bruce Wayne?

652
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,181
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

653
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,284
Hold it.

654
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,860
You good, fellas?

655
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,455
Good.

656
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,783
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

657
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,477
Sir?

658
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,165
Hey!

659
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,357
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

660
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,001
Hey, watch it, fellas.

661
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,750
You got the prince of the city there.

662
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:16,425
Some event, huh?

663
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,469
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

664
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,014
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

665
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,786
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

666
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,801
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

667
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,099
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

668
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:30,188
Wow. Is that right?

669
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,312
His father saved my life.

670
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:36,487
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

671
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:41,192
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

672
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:44,704
Operated right on the dining room table.

673
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:50,035
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

674
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,454
I remember your face.

675
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,720
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

676
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,919
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

677
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,846
"Hippocratic oath."

678
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,599
That's good.

679
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,306
Excuse me.

680
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,900
Yes.

681
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,059
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

682
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,727
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

683
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,118
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

684
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:33,998
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

685
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,529
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

686
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,068
<i>those wishing to honor the mayor's memory</i>

687
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:38,503
<i>consider a donation to</i>

688
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,630
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

689
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,961
<i>the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

690
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,262
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

691
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,178
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

692
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:52,013
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

693
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:55,316
The guy was just another rich scum-sucker.

694
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,185
He got what he deserved.

695
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,115
Know what I mean?

696
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,525
Hey, don't I know you?

697
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,700
Bruce Wayne.

698
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,578
Why haven't you called me back?

699
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:09,665
I'm sorry?

700
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,290
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

701
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,646
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

702
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,332
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

703
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:17,754
Will you walk with me?

704
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,260
Mr. Wayne.

705
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,553
Mr. Wayne.

706
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:29,349
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

707
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,772
Your family has a history of philanthropy,

708
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:34,274
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

709
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,815
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

710
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,688
Thank you.

711
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:40,571
My God.

712
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,907
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

713
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,609
I want to continue this.

714
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,832
Excuse me.

715
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,618
I'm so sorry for your loss.

716
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,749
Thank you.

717
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,600
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

718
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:03,793
Gil Colson is missing.

719
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,173
What?

720
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,550
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

721
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:08,676
Christ, not again.

722
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,849
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

723
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,183
You got people looking for him, Jim?

724
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,144
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

725
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:19,153
What'd his wife say?

726
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,636
She hadn't heard from him.

727
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,328
Get out of the car!

728
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,083
Get out of the car and show your hands!

729
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:21,711
Get out!

730
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,511
Get 'em up!

731
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,342
Get out! Show 'em!

732
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,398
Christ, it's Colson.

733
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,191
There's a bomb around his neck!

734
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,795
Let's clear this place out now!

735
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:01,918
We've got to get this place cleared out!

736
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:38,489
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

737
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:43,103
We don't know if he's in on it.

738
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,380
What's he looking at?

739
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,483
Holy shit.

740
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,191
Are you kidding me?

741
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:13,023
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

742
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,326
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

743
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,301
Please.

744
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:36,213
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

745
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,911
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

746
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:39,935
I'm so sorry.

747
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,098
Looks like a combination lock.

748
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,644
Can't we just cut it off?

749
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:46,099
Not if you want to keep your head.

750
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,010
<i>You came.</i>

751
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:26,938
Who are you?

752
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,484
<i>Me?</i>

753
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,486
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

754
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,360
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

755
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:40,740
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

756
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:42,370
"Unmask"?

757
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,618
Yes.

758
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:47,292
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

759
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,790
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

760
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:52,797
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

761
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:54,670
How am I a part of this?

762
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,672
<i>You'll see.</i>

763
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:58,574
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

764
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,680
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

765
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,007
<i>We're live.</i>

766
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:05,093
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

767
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,475
<i>At the moment,</i>

768
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:10,933
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

769
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,062
<i>is dead.</i>

770
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,215
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

771
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:15,239
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

772
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,399
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

773
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:21,485
<i>You hear me?</i>

774
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,579
Okay.

775
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,421
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

776
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,338
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

777
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,424
<i>Now,</i>

778
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:44,220
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

779
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,894
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

780
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,893
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

781
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:54,318
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

782
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:59,615
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

783
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,942
You want me to do puzzles?

784
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,778
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

785
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:08,957
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

786
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,375
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

787
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:14,900
Okay, okay. So I
just... You want me to...

788
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,256
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

789
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,961
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

790
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:25,720
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

791
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,222
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

792
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,394
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

793
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,891
- "Justice."
- Huh?

794
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:32,025
The answer's "justice."

795
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,314
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

796
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:34,983
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

797
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:39,404
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

798
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:41,868
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

799
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,318
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

800
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:45,681
Of course, of course. Of course.

801
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,072
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

802
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:52,285
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

803
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,542
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?”</i>

804
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,419
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

805
01:08:58,509 --> 01:08:59,749
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

806
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,744
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

807
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:04,617
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

808
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,881
- How much?
- Nothing!

809
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,182
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

810
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,623
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

811
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:11,480
What cases?

812
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:12,679
He didn't ask me that!

813
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:14,209
Come on! Ten grand.

814
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:17,191
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

815
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,895
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

816
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:23,823
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

817
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,322
<i>Last riddle.</i>

818
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:30,747
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

819
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:35,122
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

820
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,295
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

821
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:39,926
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

822
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,862
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

823
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,092
Twenty seconds.

824
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,840
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

825
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,950
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

826
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,518
If I go out this way, it's just me.

827
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:51,719
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

828
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,273
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

829
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,750
- People are watching.
- What people?

830
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,901
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

831
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:59,146
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

832
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:00,102
<i>Four!</i>

833
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,632
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

834
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:03,522
<i>Goodbye!</i>

835
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,165
Who do you think he is under there?

836
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,022
Take it easy.

837
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:37,107
I want to see.

838
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:39,883
What is that thing? Leather?

839
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,862
What's he got on his eyes?

840
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,468
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

841
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:47,761
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

842
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,265
Hey!

843
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:52,655
Hey! Hey! Hey!

844
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,410
Relax, God damn it!

845
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,100
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

846
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,957
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

847
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,459
Colson's blood is on his hands.

848
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,961
Maybe it's on yours.

849
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,463
What'd you say?

850
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,136
He would rather die than talk.

851
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,213
What was he afraid of?

852
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,056
You?

853
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,603
You son of a bitch.

854
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:24,186
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

855
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,990
You could be an accessory to murder.

856
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,423
Why are we playing games...

857
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,067
Get him! Come on!

858
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:32,152
Back off! Back off!

859
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,533
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

860
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,706
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

861
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,643
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

862
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,792
You too now?

863
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:46,420
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

864
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:49,097
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

865
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,580
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

866
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,717
Okay, give him the room.

867
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:12,655
Two minutes.

868
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,005
You listen to me.

869
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,584
We gotta get you out of here.

870
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:33,221
That would put a lot of heat on you.

871
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,968
Well, you punched me in the face.

872
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:38,514
Take this key.

873
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:43,182
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

874
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:46,035
Hey, what the hell is going on here?

875
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,233
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

876
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,985
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

877
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:01,124
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

878
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,260
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

879
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,747
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

880
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,343
Or he moonlights as a cop.

881
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,494
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

882
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,009
Somebody stop him!

883
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:00,105
- There he is!
- Freeze!

884
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,248
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

885
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,815
I did.

886
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:53,270
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

887
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,401
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

888
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,606
I only trust you.

889
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:59,037
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

890
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,488
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

891
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:04,375
You think Penguin's the rat?

892
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,496
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

893
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,547
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

894
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,961
DA was a regular too.

895
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:14,848
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

896
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:16,842
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

897
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:17,929
The what?

898
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,428
Riddler's latest.

899
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,222
The cipher in the maze.

900
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,800
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

901
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:27,012
A penguin's got wings too.

902
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,985
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

903
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:32,796
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

904
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,029
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

905
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:39,278
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

906
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:44,112
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

907
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:45,996
There's Penguin.

908
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,949
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

909
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:50,827
<i>You want to move in?</i>

910
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,171
<i>Let's follow.</i>

911
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:16,231
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

912
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,603
<i>I'm here.</i>

913
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:20,761
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

914
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:23,277
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

915
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:45,052
It's a drug lab. Drops.

916
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,348
This is a buy.

917
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,598
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

918
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:50,916
Or they never shut it down at all.

919
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,816
<i>What are you saying?</i>

920
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:55,017
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

921
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:20,796
This just got complicated.

922
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:22,715
What do you mean?

923
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,100
Hey! What happened?

924
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,518
You all right?

925
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,077
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

926
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,776
Jesus.

927
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,369
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

928
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:50,208
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

929
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,998
Is that why you work in the club?

930
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:53,795
It was all just a score?

931
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:57,667
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

932
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:01,049
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

933
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,271
Jesus!

934
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:42,957
Hey, Vengeance!

935
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,845
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

936
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,338
Kenzie! Get the money!

937
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,011
Hey! What the...

938
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:28,987
Whoa!

939
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,784
Come on! Come on!

940
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,288
This guy's crazy!

941
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,751
Come on! Hey!

942
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,220
Move!

943
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,901
Get out of the way!

944
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,129
Come on!

945
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:00,965
Get out of the way!

946
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:40,259
I got you!

947
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:42,848
I got you!

948
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:45,267
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

949
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:46,810
I got you!

950
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:06,098
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

951
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:08,801
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

952
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:10,248
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

953
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,690
Cops caught you doing something.

954
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,459
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

955
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:15,361
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

956
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,560
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

957
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:18,860
His drops operation.

958
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,408
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

959
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:25,109
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

960
01:25:25,203 --> 01:25:27,015
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

961
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,375
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

962
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:32,667
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

963
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:33,914
What are you, crazy?

964
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:35,148
That why you killed the girl?

965
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:36,172
I didn't kill no girl!

966
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,008
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

967
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:39,385
But she got too close, right?

968
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,738
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

969
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,719
But somehow Riddler found out too.

970
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,716
He knows so much about you.

971
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,844
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

972
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:50,642
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

973
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:52,481
Why don't you start harmonizing?

974
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,234
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

975
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:56,648
I ain't no rat!

976
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,630
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

977
01:25:58,654 --> 01:25:59,797
if he heard this kind of talk?

978
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,983
Oh, you don't wanna talk about rats, huh?

979
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:04,618
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

980
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,261
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

981
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:07,955
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

982
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:09,949
Open your eyes!

983
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:15,459
Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>

984
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:17,035
<i>El Rata Alada?</i>

985
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,966
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

986
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:21,385
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

987
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:24,051
It says you are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>

988
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:25,514
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

989
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:26,866
Why, you got something to tell us?

990
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:27,890
Yeah!

991
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:29,535
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

992
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:30,559
What?

993
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:32,142
It's <i>"La."</i>

994
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:33,515
<i>"La" rata.</i>

995
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,025
What, is this Riddler stupid or something?

996
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:37,974
Jesus! Look at you two.

997
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:40,643
World's greatest detectives!

998
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:43,424
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"fa"?</i>

999
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:44,529
Jesus!

1000
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,106
No <i>habla español,</i> fellas?

1001
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,192
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1002
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:50,741
You think he made a mistake?

1003
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:51,999
He doesn't make mistakes.

1004
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,117
A rat with wings?

1005
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,793
You know what that sounds like to me?

1006
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:58,039
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1007
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:00,121
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

1008
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:09,630
"You are <i>el."</i>

1009
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:19,806
Maybe it was a mistake.

1010
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,153
Maybe he isn't as
smart as... Wait.

1011
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:26,738
Is that him?

1012
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:29,449
Holy shit.

1013
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:51,697
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1014
01:28:20,337 --> 01:28:23,955
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

1015
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,882
But in a mansion, in a slum,

1016
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,879
I'll never know where I come from.

1017
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:31,094
Do you know what I am?"

1018
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:32,181
Any idea?

1019
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:33,724
Yeah.

1020
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,383
It's an orphan.

1021
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,019
A mansion in a slum.

1022
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,213
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

1023
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:52,950
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1024
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:55,223
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1025
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:56,247
Let's go.

1026
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,792
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

1027
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:04,203
You gonna untie me?

1028
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:06,547
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

1029
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:10,678
Hey!

1030
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,550
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1031
01:29:28,655 --> 01:29:30,817
No guns.

1032
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:34,321
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

1033
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:56,638
What's that?

1034
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:09,063
Hey! Hey!

1035
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:16,741
Dropheads.

1036
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:25,785
What the hell is that?

1037
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:39,924
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

1038
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:41,304
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

1039
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:46,101
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

1040
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:48,106
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

1041
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:51,443
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

1042
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:54,525
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

1043
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:59,201
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

1044
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:01,532
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

1045
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:04,456
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

1046
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:07,876
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

1047
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:10,287
<i>Win or lose,</i>

1048
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:13,170
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

1049
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:16,468
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

1050
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:21,094
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

1051
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:23,095
<i>who need it now,</i>

1052
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:24,646
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

1053
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:26,140
"Sins of the father."

1054
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:28,881
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

1055
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:33,234
<i>and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

1056
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:39,324
Shall be visited upon the son.

1057
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:44,447
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1058
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,456
Hey!

1059
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:52,685
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

1060
01:32:52,776 --> 01:32:54,608
- Oh, <i>Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

1061
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:56,444
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1062
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,070
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1063
01:33:10,877 --> 01:33:12,618
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

1064
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:15,458
I'm so sorry.

1065
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:18,666
I've been trying to reach you.

1066
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:23,189
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

1067
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:27,383
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

1068
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,741
We've sedated him.

1069
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:53,585
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1070
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:57,045
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1071
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,331
Is there anyone else to notify?

1072
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,088
Next of kin?

1073
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:08,306
No.

1074
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:11,051
It's just me.

1075
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:55,405
Selina?

1076
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,048
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1077
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:08,589
- Yeah, I can see you.
<i>- I need to talk to you.</i>

1078
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,553
<i>Where can we go?</i>

1079
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:31,153
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1080
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:34,703
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1081
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:37,639
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

1082
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,658
How could they do that to her?

1083
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,709
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1084
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:43,707
Her body was in his car.

1085
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,676
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1086
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:49,751
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1087
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:51,448
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1088
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:53,088
She didn't know any better.

1089
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:54,576
Maybe you should have explained it to her.

1090
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,160
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1091
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:57,788
It means your choices have consequences.

1092
01:36:57,812 --> 01:37:00,179
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1093
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,984
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1094
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,899
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1095
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:07,398
Compromising yourself for money?

1096
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,022
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1097
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:16,324
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1098
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:17,808
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1099
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:19,167
Falcone owes me that money.

1100
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,002
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1101
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:21,920
Oh, really? Why's that?

1102
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:22,921
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1103
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:24,756
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1104
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:25,840
would owe you anything.

1105
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:28,255
Because he's my father!

1106
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:40,181
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1107
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:42,975
Just like Anni.

1108
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:47,688
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1109
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:51,112
To the club?

1110
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:53,033
Yeah.

1111
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:58,612
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1112
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:00,823
Used to see him there.

1113
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:03,575
He scared the shit out of me.

1114
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:09,005
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1115
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:13,384
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1116
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:19,098
When I was seven, my mother was murdered.

1117
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:21,259
Strangled.

1118
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:25,146
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1119
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:29,112
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1120
01:38:29,195 --> 01:38:31,357
and he didn't say a thing.

1121
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:34,985
Couldn't even look at me.

1122
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:40,487
He owes me that money.

1123
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:43,702
I'm sorry.

1124
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:45,997
For what I said.

1125
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,791
Oh, it's all right.

1126
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:54,425
You assume the worst in people.

1127
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:56,711
Which, well...

1128
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:00,966
maybe we're not so different after all.

1129
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:08,140
Who are you under there?

1130
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:16,106
What are you hiding?

1131
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:20,326
Are you just...

1132
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:23,621
hideously scarred?

1133
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:26,751
Yeah.

1134
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,421
Listen to me.

1135
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:39,838
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1136
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:45,682
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1137
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:49,397
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1138
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:50,735
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1139
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:52,098
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1140
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:54,197
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1141
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:55,532
I think you'd be on his side.

1142
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:57,295
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1143
01:39:57,325 --> 01:39:59,282
What, do you live in a cave?

1144
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:01,718
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1145
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:06,406
Listen, if I can find that dickbag Kenzie,

1146
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:07,707
will you help me?

1147
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:10,247
Please.

1148
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:14,960
Come on, Vengeance.

1149
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:19,681
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

1150
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,964
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1151
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:32,478
I told you, baby.

1152
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:36,986
I can take care of myself.

1153
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:51,080
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

1154
01:40:58,928 --> 01:41:02,512
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

1155
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,472
<i>instilled in both of us</i>

1156
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:07,096
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

1157
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:08,726
<i>it's a passion.</i>

1158
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:11,770
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

1159
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:15,316
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

1160
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:17,861
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

1161
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:21,110
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

1162
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:27,116
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

1163
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:30,870
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

1164
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:33,129
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

1165
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:35,704
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

1166
01:41:35,798 --> 01:41:37,414
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

1167
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:43,094
<i>and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

1168
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:47,845
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

1169
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,302
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

1170
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:53,647
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

1171
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:57,647
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

1172
01:41:57,778 --> 01:41:59,815
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

1173
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:04,612
<i>Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

1174
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:07,285
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

1175
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:10,451
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

1176
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:16,287
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

1177
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:19,164
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

1178
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:21,625
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

1179
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:25,178
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

1180
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:28,052
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

1181
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:31,434
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1182
01:42:37,193 --> 01:42:38,274
Do you know who I am?

1183
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:41,019
You're Bruce Wayne.

1184
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:42,979
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1185
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:54,751
See?

1186
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:08,672
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1187
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:11,549
Must have made a fortune.

1188
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:14,369
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1189
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:17,730
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1190
01:43:17,817 --> 01:43:18,817
No, boss.

1191
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:21,233
$1,183.

1192
01:43:21,821 --> 01:43:23,778
You know why communism failed, right?

1193
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:24,864
No, boss.

1194
01:43:26,784 --> 01:43:28,024
Austerity.

1195
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:31,903
All right. All right.

1196
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:34,573
Look at that. Perfect.

1197
01:43:34,667 --> 01:43:36,467
It's never gonna be that good again.

1198
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:41,121
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1199
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:42,415
What are you doing here?

1200
01:43:44,301 --> 01:43:46,133
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1201
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:48,089
Come on.

1202
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:51,221
See ya, champ.

1203
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:53,466
Come on, sweetheart.

1204
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:56,438
Have a seat.

1205
01:43:58,482 --> 01:44:00,268
I thought I might hear from you.

1206
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:04,562
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

1207
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:07,901
stirring things up, huh?

1208
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:09,699
- Is it true?
- What?

1209
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:12,611
That reporter business?

1210
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:15,225
What do you want to know here, kid?

1211
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:18,037
Did you kill him? For my father?

1212
01:44:18,127 --> 01:44:20,869
Look, your father was in trouble.

1213
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:23,542
This reporter had some dirt.

1214
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:25,248
Some very...

1215
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:30,170
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1216
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:32,975
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1217
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:34,578
But he didn't want none of it coming out,

1218
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:36,513
not right before the election.

1219
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:39,266
And your father tried to pay the guy off,

1220
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:40,972
but he wasn't going for it.

1221
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:44,229
So, he came to me.

1222
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,687
Well, I never seen him like that.

1223
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:49,363
He said, "Carmine,

1224
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:54,869
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

1225
01:44:57,291 --> 01:45:00,204
And when fear isn't enough...

1226
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:02,710
Oof. Hmm.

1227
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:07,382
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1228
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:10,217
I handled it.

1229
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:13,342
I know.

1230
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:15,673
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1231
01:45:16,936 --> 01:45:18,768
But you'd be surprised

1232
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:21,221
what even a good man like him

1233
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:23,898
is capable of in the right situation.

1234
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:27,609
Do me a favor.

1235
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:29,984
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1236
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:32,281
This reporter

1237
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:34,700
was a lowlife.

1238
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:36,243
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1239
01:45:37,873 --> 01:45:39,489
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1240
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:43,494
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1241
01:45:44,922 --> 01:45:48,415
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1242
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:50,841
that your father would be in my pocket,

1243
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:52,595
forever.

1244
01:45:53,264 --> 01:45:55,301
He would have done anything

1245
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:57,553
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1246
01:45:57,643 --> 01:45:58,974
You understand?

1247
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:04,727
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1248
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:06,854
Do I know I for a fact?

1249
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,580
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1250
01:46:12,741 --> 01:46:15,028
This is what you wanted, huh?

1251
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,531
This little conversation here?

1252
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:22,119
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1253
01:46:24,753 --> 01:46:26,869
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1254
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:37,569
You lied to me...

1255
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:42,028
my whole life.

1256
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:49,248
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1257
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:55,629
He told me what he did for my father.

1258
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,130
About Salvatore Maroni.

1259
01:48:03,143 --> 01:48:05,851
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1260
01:48:05,938 --> 01:48:07,679
Had my father killed.

1261
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:12,357
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1262
01:48:15,114 --> 01:48:19,654
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1263
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:22,075
believing that he was a good man.

1264
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:23,744
He was a good man.

1265
01:48:24,915 --> 01:48:26,622
You listen to me.

1266
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:30,122
Your father was a good man.

1267
01:48:33,757 --> 01:48:35,668
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1268
01:48:35,759 --> 01:48:37,670
He had a man killed.

1269
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:38,842
Why?

1270
01:48:40,014 --> 01:48:43,257
To protect his family image?

1271
01:48:44,351 --> 01:48:45,603
His political aspirations?

1272
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:49,236
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1273
01:48:51,817 --> 01:48:53,353
He was protecting your mother.

1274
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:57,857
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1275
01:48:57,948 --> 01:49:01,445
He cared about her, and you,

1276
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:04,448
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1277
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:07,997
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1278
01:49:08,876 --> 01:49:12,210
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1279
01:49:12,296 --> 01:49:15,414
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1280
01:49:15,507 --> 01:49:17,339
That's who Falcone is.

1281
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:21,802
And that was your father's mistake.

1282
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:23,933
But when Falcone told him what he'd done,

1283
01:49:24,016 --> 01:49:26,758
your father was distraught.

1284
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:30,853
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1285
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:33,101
that he would confess everything.

1286
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:36,601
And that night,

1287
01:49:36,695 --> 01:49:40,609
your father and your mother were killed.

1288
01:49:46,121 --> 01:49:47,862
It was Falcone?

1289
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:56,037
On, I wish I knew for sure.

1290
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:04,299
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1291
01:50:04,389 --> 01:50:07,143
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1292
01:50:07,226 --> 01:50:12,437
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1293
01:50:14,191 --> 01:50:18,059
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1294
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:20,523
I know you always blamed yourself.

1295
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:23,151
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1296
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:27,614
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1297
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:31,406
but I didn't know how to help.

1298
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,992
I could teach you how to fight,

1299
01:50:35,379 --> 01:50:38,041
but I wasn't equipped to take care of you.

1300
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:39,964
You needed a father.

1301
01:50:41,927 --> 01:50:44,339
And all you had was me.

1302
01:50:46,723 --> 01:50:47,929
I'm sorry.

1303
01:50:49,685 --> 01:50:51,596
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1304
01:50:58,402 --> 01:50:59,483
God.

1305
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:06,946
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1306
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:11,779
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1307
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,453
I mean,

1308
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:22,790
I'm not afraid to die.

1309
01:51:24,553 --> 01:51:26,920
I realize now there's something

1310
01:51:28,056 --> 01:51:29,922
I haven't got past.

1311
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:32,592
This fear...

1312
01:51:35,063 --> 01:51:38,021
of ever going through any of that again.

1313
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:44,486
Of losing somebody I care about.

1314
01:52:35,082 --> 01:52:36,082
Hey.

1315
01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:38,866
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1316
01:52:38,961 --> 01:52:40,872
I thought it was you.

1317
01:52:53,809 --> 01:52:55,345
- I found him!
- I see that.

1318
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:56,925
He had my shit and my phone.

1319
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,289
She left a message
the night they took her.

1320
01:52:58,313 --> 01:53:01,021
She called me... Gordon!
Help me out, man!

1321
01:53:01,108 --> 01:53:02,394
She got my gun!

1322
01:53:03,735 --> 01:53:05,442
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1323
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:09,526
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1324
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:16,203
Here. Listen.

1325
01:53:18,166 --> 01:53:19,827
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1326
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,160
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1327
01:53:22,212 --> 01:53:24,294
<i>Hey, hey, what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1328
01:53:24,381 --> 01:53:25,712
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1329
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:27,506
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1330
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:28,695
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1331
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,012
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1332
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:32,757
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1333
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:36,678
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1334
01:53:37,394 --> 01:53:39,931
<i>- What did Mitchell tell you?
- No, nothing. He...</i>

1335
01:53:40,022 --> 01:53:42,935
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1336
01:53:43,025 --> 01:53:45,733
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1337
01:53:46,278 --> 01:53:48,378
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1338
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:51,856
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1339
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:54,658
<i>All I want to do is get out of here, okay?</i>

1340
01:53:54,745 --> 01:53:56,931
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1341
01:53:56,955 --> 01:54:00,073
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1342
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:03,454
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1343
01:54:04,546 --> 01:54:05,877
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1344
01:54:06,673 --> 01:54:10,211
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1345
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:11,925
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1346
01:54:12,012 --> 01:54:13,969
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1347
01:54:14,056 --> 01:54:15,342
<i>The deal.</i>

1348
01:54:15,432 --> 01:54:20,347
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1349
01:54:20,437 --> 01:54:23,145
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1350
01:54:23,231 --> 01:54:25,598
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1351
01:54:25,692 --> 01:54:26,807
<i>Right.</i>

1352
01:54:27,569 --> 01:54:28,934
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1353
01:54:29,905 --> 01:54:32,067
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1354
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:41,142
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

1355
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:42,702
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1356
01:54:42,793 --> 01:54:45,831
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1357
01:54:55,055 --> 01:54:56,341
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1358
01:55:01,103 --> 01:55:02,889
A falcon has wings too.

1359
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:05,062
Falcone is the rat?

1360
01:55:16,034 --> 01:55:19,197
Falcone works for you guys?

1361
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:22,408
The mayor? The DA?

1362
01:55:25,419 --> 01:55:26,500
No.

1363
01:55:29,589 --> 01:55:30,875
We work for him.

1364
01:55:31,883 --> 01:55:33,123
Everybody does.

1365
01:55:33,218 --> 01:55:34,218
How?

1366
01:55:34,302 --> 01:55:35,884
Through Renewal.

1367
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:38,045
Renewal is everything.

1368
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:39,540
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1369
01:55:40,058 --> 01:55:43,767
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1370
01:55:43,854 --> 01:55:47,438
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1371
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:50,892
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1372
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:53,068
A huge charitable fund with no oversight.

1373
01:55:53,155 --> 01:55:54,862
Everybody got a piece.

1374
01:55:54,948 --> 01:55:56,780
But Falcone wanted more.

1375
01:55:58,577 --> 01:56:01,786
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1376
01:56:03,206 --> 01:56:05,538
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1377
01:56:05,917 --> 01:56:08,625
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1378
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:11,170
then install them all as his puppets.

1379
01:56:11,256 --> 01:56:13,793
You think this goddamn election matters?

1380
01:56:15,427 --> 01:56:17,338
Falcone's the mayor.

1381
01:56:18,305 --> 01:56:20,797
He's been the mayor for the last 20 years.

1382
01:56:20,891 --> 01:56:22,256
Come on, Vengeance.

1383
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:24,808
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1384
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,206
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1385
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:28,230
No!

1386
01:56:29,524 --> 01:56:30,730
We'll get him.

1387
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:33,278
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1388
01:56:33,361 --> 01:56:34,476
He owns the city!

1389
01:56:34,571 --> 01:56:35,811
Cross that line...

1390
01:56:36,615 --> 01:56:38,015
you'll become just like him.

1391
01:56:38,617 --> 01:56:40,153
Listen to me.

1392
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:42,109
Don't throw your life away.

1393
01:56:48,668 --> 01:56:50,033
Don't worry, honey.

1394
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:54,587
I got nine of 'em.

1395
01:56:54,716 --> 01:56:56,673
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1396
01:56:57,969 --> 01:56:59,255
Oh, God!

1397
01:57:08,563 --> 01:57:09,832
She won't get out of there alive.

1398
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:12,443
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1399
01:57:12,526 --> 01:57:13,526
I have to stop her.

1400
01:57:13,693 --> 01:57:14,693
Don't you mean "we"?

1401
01:57:15,987 --> 01:57:17,523
I gotta do this my way.

1402
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:18,864
And then what?

1403
01:57:19,741 --> 01:57:21,106
We do what Riddler said.

1404
01:57:21,952 --> 01:57:23,568
Bring the rat into the light.

1405
01:57:59,531 --> 01:58:01,575
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1406
01:58:01,658 --> 01:58:03,208
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1407
01:58:03,743 --> 01:58:05,093
Tell him it's about Annika.

1408
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:09,662
Hey!

1409
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:11,911
Look who it is, huh?

1410
01:58:12,002 --> 01:58:14,421
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1411
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:16,590
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1412
01:58:16,673 --> 01:58:18,129
Absolutely.

1413
01:58:19,884 --> 01:58:20,884
Alone?

1414
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:38,525
Hey!

1415
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,349
I'm just so worried.

1416
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:51,989
I don't know where she is.

1417
01:58:53,752 --> 01:58:57,120
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1418
01:58:57,213 --> 01:59:00,626
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1419
01:59:02,135 --> 01:59:04,685
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

1420
01:59:05,972 --> 01:59:07,087
I'm sorry.

1421
01:59:07,307 --> 01:59:08,388
It's okay.

1422
01:59:08,475 --> 01:59:10,591
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1423
01:59:10,769 --> 01:59:13,636
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1424
01:59:17,901 --> 01:59:18,811
Mr. Falcone?

1425
01:59:18,902 --> 01:59:20,358
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1426
01:59:20,445 --> 01:59:23,845
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1427
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:27,232
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1428
01:59:27,327 --> 01:59:28,738
I'll be right back.

1429
01:59:44,052 --> 01:59:45,133
Holy shit.

1430
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:46,947
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

1444
02:00:26,344 --> 02:00:28,711
<i>Revelations of
Mr. Falcone's secret role</i>

1445
02:00:28,805 --> 02:00:30,045
<i>as a mafia informant...</i>

1446
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:31,880
Hey, Dad.

1447
02:00:32,934 --> 02:00:33,934
What?

1448
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:36,431
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1449
02:00:38,064 --> 02:00:39,520
You remember her?

1450
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:42,603
Yeah.

1451
02:00:46,906 --> 02:00:48,050
Just put down the gun, honey.

1452
02:00:48,074 --> 02:00:49,174
This is for my mother.

1453
02:01:46,424 --> 02:01:47,585
I see him!

1454
02:02:31,636 --> 02:02:33,377
You don't think this hurts me?

1455
02:02:37,976 --> 02:02:40,263
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1456
02:02:56,661 --> 02:02:58,493
You made me do this.

1457
02:02:59,914 --> 02:03:01,700
Just like your mother.

1458
02:03:07,714 --> 02:03:09,045
He has to pay!

1459
02:03:12,969 --> 02:03:14,519
You don't have to pay with him.

1460
02:03:17,724 --> 02:03:19,214
You paid enough.

1461
02:03:53,801 --> 02:03:54,916
Jesus.

1462
02:03:55,011 --> 02:03:57,719
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1463
02:03:57,805 --> 02:04:00,888
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

1464
02:04:00,975 --> 02:04:02,215
I'm gonna start crying,

1465
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:04,802
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

1466
02:04:04,896 --> 02:04:06,512
Let me tell you something.

1467
02:04:06,606 --> 02:04:10,265
Whatever I know, whatever I've done,

1468
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:14,695
it's all going with me to my grave.

1469
02:04:25,249 --> 02:04:27,206
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1470
02:04:28,836 --> 02:04:31,123
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

1471
02:04:39,055 --> 02:04:41,387
I guess we don't all work for you.

1472
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:52,200
You have the right to remain silent.

1473
02:04:52,777 --> 02:04:56,270
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1474
02:04:56,364 --> 02:04:57,724
You have the right to an attorney.

1475
02:04:57,782 --> 02:04:58,950
If you cannot afford one,

1476
02:04:59,033 --> 02:05:00,827
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1477
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:02,617
Do you understand these rights?

1478
02:05:04,122 --> 02:05:05,704
Do you understand?

1479
02:05:07,667 --> 02:05:08,748
Yeah.

1480
02:05:08,835 --> 02:05:10,917
I'll see you when I walk out.

1481
02:05:11,004 --> 02:05:12,064
With these rights in mind,

1482
02:05:12,088 --> 02:05:13,440
is there anything else you wish to tell...

1483
02:05:13,464 --> 02:05:14,704
Goddamn rat.

1484
02:05:16,676 --> 02:05:18,007
What'd you say?

1485
02:05:18,094 --> 02:05:20,044
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

1486
02:05:20,972 --> 02:05:22,212
Probably be your last.

1487
02:05:22,473 --> 02:05:25,511
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1488
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:26,682
Maybe I am.

1489
02:05:26,769 --> 02:05:27,975
Really, Oz?

1490
02:05:28,062 --> 02:05:32,772
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1491
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:34,159
I'll spray paint your ass!

1492
02:05:38,031 --> 02:05:39,491
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1493
02:05:39,574 --> 02:05:41,565
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

1494
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:44,366
Get your hands off of me!

1495
02:06:03,931 --> 02:06:05,922
"Bring him into the light.

1496
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:11,477
And you'll find where I'm at."”

1497
02:06:11,564 --> 02:06:12,645
There!

1498
02:06:12,732 --> 02:06:14,564
The shots came from up there!

1499
02:06:16,152 --> 02:06:17,152
It's Riddler.

1500
02:06:19,238 --> 02:06:20,399
Gage, on me.

1501
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:23,490
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

1502
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:38,606
He's gone.

1503
02:07:48,411 --> 02:07:50,368
He's been here this whole time.

1504
02:07:50,454 --> 02:07:52,786
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

1505
02:07:52,874 --> 02:07:54,059
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

1506
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:56,812
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

1507
02:07:56,836 --> 02:07:59,294
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

1508
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:02,293
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

1509
02:08:17,815 --> 02:08:19,897
Police! Hands up!

1510
02:08:22,945 --> 02:08:26,438
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1511
02:08:45,593 --> 02:08:47,504
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1512
02:08:50,473 --> 02:08:51,759
Stay still!

1513
02:08:51,849 --> 02:08:52,849
Now!

1514
02:09:21,504 --> 02:09:23,290
Which one is you?

1515
02:09:23,381 --> 02:09:24,871
You tell me.

1516
02:09:25,716 --> 02:09:27,172
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1517
02:09:30,263 --> 02:09:32,063
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1518
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:49,449
<i>Where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

1519
02:09:49,532 --> 02:09:52,115
<i>have gathered
in an emotional show of city unity.</i>

1520
02:09:52,201 --> 02:09:54,787
<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live
inside Reál's headquarters right now...</i>

1521
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:55,905
Hey.

1522
02:10:20,354 --> 02:10:22,061
What are all these diaries?

1523
02:10:22,148 --> 02:10:24,560
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1524
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:28,188
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1525
02:10:28,279 --> 02:10:29,822
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1526
02:10:29,905 --> 02:10:32,192
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1527
02:10:32,283 --> 02:10:34,118
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1528
02:10:34,201 --> 02:10:36,613
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1529
02:10:36,704 --> 02:10:38,445
What about chain of evidence?

1530
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:40,496
You should see this.

1531
02:10:46,464 --> 02:10:47,954
He's wearing gloves.

1532
02:10:49,425 --> 02:10:51,666
"Friday, July 16th.

1533
02:10:51,761 --> 02:10:55,470
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1534
02:10:55,806 --> 02:10:58,844
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1535
02:10:58,934 --> 02:11:00,345
But then, today, I saw it.

1536
02:11:00,436 --> 02:11:04,555
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1537
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:07,686
'Renewal.'

1538
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:12,192
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1539
02:11:12,281 --> 02:11:15,399
One look inside, and finally I understood.

1540
02:11:15,493 --> 02:11:18,827
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1541
02:11:18,913 --> 02:11:21,371
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1542
02:11:21,457 --> 02:11:24,449
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1543
02:11:25,586 --> 02:11:27,481
"If you want people to understand,

1544
02:11:27,505 --> 02:11:29,337
really understand,

1545
02:11:29,423 --> 02:11:31,710
you can't just give them the answers.

1546
02:11:31,801 --> 02:11:33,257
You have to confront them,

1547
02:11:33,344 --> 02:11:35,756
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1548
02:11:35,846 --> 02:11:38,008
just like they tortured me.

1549
02:11:38,099 --> 02:11:40,887
I know now what I must become."

1550
02:11:43,854 --> 02:11:45,185
Jesus.

1551
02:11:51,278 --> 02:11:53,235
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1552
02:11:53,781 --> 02:11:55,271
This one's not a rat.

1553
02:12:11,924 --> 02:12:13,039
What is that?

1554
02:12:44,665 --> 02:12:45,934
Some kind of pry tool?

1555
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:47,323
Is it a chisel?

1556
02:12:47,418 --> 02:12:48,874
It's a murder weapon.

1557
02:12:48,961 --> 02:12:50,326
He killed Mitchell with it.

1558
02:12:51,005 --> 02:12:54,305
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1559
02:13:02,475 --> 02:13:04,466
"My confession"?

1560
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:07,438
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1561
02:13:07,521 --> 02:13:08,886
This isn't over.

1562
02:13:08,981 --> 02:13:11,531
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1563
02:13:11,817 --> 02:13:14,217
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1564
02:13:22,119 --> 02:13:24,326
His final post was last night.

1565
02:13:24,413 --> 02:13:27,622
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1566
02:13:27,708 --> 02:13:30,700
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

1567
02:13:30,836 --> 02:13:34,249
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1568
02:13:45,601 --> 02:13:48,138
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1569
02:13:49,772 --> 02:13:51,479
"The Truth Unmasked."

1570
02:13:52,316 --> 02:13:53,932
I think I'm his last target.

1571
02:13:56,529 --> 02:13:57,610
You?

1572
02:13:57,988 --> 02:14:00,025
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1573
02:14:00,574 --> 02:14:01,939
What is?

1574
02:14:02,409 --> 02:14:03,820
The Batman.

1575
02:14:09,208 --> 02:14:10,369
Yeah?

1576
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:22,885
Right.

1577
02:14:25,766 --> 02:14:29,725
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1578
02:14:37,194 --> 02:14:38,684
You're a good cop.

1579
02:15:03,304 --> 02:15:05,671
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

1580
02:15:06,432 --> 02:15:08,264
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1581
02:15:08,350 --> 02:15:09,886
"Want"?

1582
02:15:10,477 --> 02:15:14,095
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

1583
02:15:15,316 --> 02:15:16,647
<i>For this moment.</i>

1584
02:15:17,693 --> 02:15:20,685
I've been invisible my whole life.

1585
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:24,397
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1586
02:15:25,951 --> 02:15:28,363
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

1587
02:15:28,454 --> 02:15:30,286
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

1588
02:15:40,674 --> 02:15:42,631
<i>Bruce...</i>

1589
02:15:45,512 --> 02:15:47,344
<i>Wayne.</i>

1590
02:15:49,725 --> 02:15:53,468
Bruce...

1591
02:15:54,897 --> 02:15:57,764
<i>Wayne.</i>

1592
02:16:09,036 --> 02:16:11,448
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

1593
02:16:14,041 --> 02:16:17,409
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

1594
02:16:17,503 --> 02:16:19,870
<i>made all those promises.</i>

1595
02:16:22,341 --> 02:16:26,585
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

1596
02:16:27,137 --> 02:16:30,675
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

1597
02:16:30,766 --> 02:16:34,430
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

1598
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:36,556
<i>Orphan.</i>

1599
02:16:42,236 --> 02:16:47,356
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

1600
02:16:48,659 --> 02:16:53,278
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

1601
02:16:53,956 --> 02:16:55,492
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

1602
02:16:58,127 --> 02:17:00,789
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1603
02:17:01,171 --> 02:17:03,754
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

1604
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:09,089
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

1605
02:17:10,806 --> 02:17:15,471
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

1606
02:17:16,645 --> 02:17:19,808
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

1607
02:17:19,898 --> 02:17:22,185
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

1608
02:17:23,485 --> 02:17:26,068
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

1609
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:32,154
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

1610
02:17:32,244 --> 02:17:35,157
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

1611
02:17:35,247 --> 02:17:36,247
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

1612
02:17:37,708 --> 02:17:39,745
<i>Bruce...</i>

1613
02:17:40,794 --> 02:17:42,705
<i>Wayne.</i>

1614
02:17:46,383 --> 02:17:49,466
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

1615
02:17:52,890 --> 02:17:56,008
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

1616
02:17:57,478 --> 02:18:01,346
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

1617
02:18:04,526 --> 02:18:05,687
<i>God.</i>

1618
02:18:06,695 --> 02:18:07,981
<i>Look at you.</i>

1619
02:18:09,656 --> 02:18:12,114
Your mask is amazing.

1620
02:18:12,201 --> 02:18:15,114
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1621
02:18:15,204 --> 02:18:16,285
Ain't it funny??

1622
02:18:16,371 --> 02:18:20,786
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

1623
02:18:22,252 --> 02:18:24,289
<i>You and I both know</i>

1624
02:18:25,255 --> 02:18:27,747
<i>I'm looking at the real you right now.</i>

1625
02:18:27,841 --> 02:18:31,459
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

1626
02:18:31,553 --> 02:18:33,089
<i>No shame,</i>

1627
02:18:34,014 --> 02:18:35,014
<i>no limits.</i>

1628
02:18:35,098 --> 02:18:36,759
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

1629
02:18:37,643 --> 02:18:38,643
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1630
02:18:38,727 --> 02:18:40,434
<i>All those cards.</i>

1631
02:18:40,521 --> 02:18:41,727
<i>I told you,</i>

1632
02:18:42,439 --> 02:18:44,417
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

1633
02:18:44,441 --> 02:18:46,648
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

1634
02:18:46,735 --> 02:18:48,191
<i>What did we just do?</i>

1635
02:18:48,278 --> 02:18:50,340
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

1636
02:18:50,364 --> 02:18:51,525
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

1637
02:18:51,615 --> 02:18:52,615
<i>We're not a team.</i>

1638
02:18:52,699 --> 02:18:55,191
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

1639
02:18:55,285 --> 02:18:57,697
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

1640
02:18:57,788 --> 02:19:00,951
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

1641
02:19:01,041 --> 02:19:02,681
But I didn't know how to make them listen.

1642
02:19:02,751 --> 02:19:03,957
You gave me that.

1643
02:19:04,044 --> 02:19:05,159
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

1644
02:19:05,254 --> 02:19:07,837
You showed me what was possible.

1645
02:19:07,923 --> 02:19:12,793
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

1646
02:19:12,886 --> 02:19:14,422
<i>You inspired me.</i>

1647
02:19:14,513 --> 02:19:16,113
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

1648
02:19:17,140 --> 02:19:18,221
<i>What?</i>

1649
02:19:18,308 --> 02:19:20,478
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

1650
02:19:20,561 --> 02:19:21,926
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1651
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:23,522
You think you'll be remembered?

1652
02:19:23,605 --> 02:19:25,266
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

1653
02:19:25,774 --> 02:19:27,515
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

1654
02:19:27,609 --> 02:19:29,278
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

1655
02:19:29,361 --> 02:19:30,396
<i>No, no!</i>

1656
02:19:30,487 --> 02:19:31,487
<i>A nobody!</i>

1657
02:19:33,198 --> 02:19:34,984
<i>No!</i>

1658
02:19:36,910 --> 02:19:39,277
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1659
02:19:39,538 --> 02:19:42,121
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

1660
02:19:43,083 --> 02:19:46,701
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1661
02:19:46,795 --> 02:19:49,412
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

1662
02:19:50,424 --> 02:19:52,415
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

1663
02:19:52,801 --> 02:19:56,089
We could watch the whole thing together.

1664
02:19:56,179 --> 02:19:57,179
<i>Watch what?</i>

1665
02:19:57,264 --> 02:19:59,005
<i>Everything!</i>

1666
02:20:07,357 --> 02:20:09,018
<i>It was all there.</i>

1667
02:20:11,194 --> 02:20:13,526
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

1668
02:20:17,826 --> 02:20:21,740
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

1669
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:25,872
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

1670
02:20:26,335 --> 02:20:27,575
<i>What have you done?</i>

1671
02:20:28,295 --> 02:20:33,165
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

1672
02:20:36,011 --> 02:20:37,843
<i>You.</i>

1673
02:20:39,514 --> 02:20:41,630
<i>If you think you can stop what's coming...</i>

1674
02:20:42,976 --> 02:20:44,512
<i>What have you done?</i>

1675
02:20:46,063 --> 02:20:51,900
<i>Ave Maria</i>

1676
02:20:52,319 --> 02:20:54,185
<i>What have you done?</i>

1677
02:20:56,657 --> 02:20:59,611
<i>Gratia plena What have you done?</i>

1678
02:21:03,622 --> 02:21:10,629
<i>Maria Gratia plena</i>

1679
02:21:44,579 --> 02:21:45,944
Hey!

1680
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:48,307
What are you doing in here?

1681
02:22:06,184 --> 02:22:08,984
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1682
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:17,818
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

1683
02:22:18,697 --> 02:22:21,439
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1684
02:22:26,121 --> 02:22:29,159
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

1685
02:22:29,249 --> 02:22:31,411
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

1686
02:22:31,501 --> 02:22:33,742
It's a tucker.

1687
02:22:51,563 --> 02:22:52,563
Huh.

1688
02:23:07,746 --> 02:23:10,541
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1689
02:23:10,624 --> 02:23:12,114
What are you doing?

1690
02:23:42,656 --> 02:23:44,067
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

02:23:44,407 --> 02:23:46,614
<i>Uh, thanks for all the comments</i>

1692

<i>And a special thanks to everyone
for the tips on detonators.</i>

1693
02:23:49,746 --> 02:23:50,746
Detonators?

1694
02:23:50,831 --> 02:23:55,871
<i>I just want to say this will be my last

<i>But we know the truth, don't we?</i>

<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

1706
02:24:34,541 --> 02:24:37,499
<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

1707
02:24:37,586 --> 02:24:41,420
<i>masquerading under the guise of renewal.</i>

1708

<i>But unmasking is not enough.</i>

<i>And now it is time</i>

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

<i>Those who are not washed away</i>

<i>celebrations will turn to panic,</i>

I can't get through! The lines are down.

Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1745
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:27,544
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1751
02:27:44,147 --> 02:27:45,416
And get the mayor-elect out of here, now.

02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:46,358
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

Come!

02:28:25,772 --> 02:28:27,208
The water's already started to breach.

1757
02:28:27,232 --> 02:28:28,834
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

1758
02:28:28,858 --> 02:28:31,128
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1759
02:28:31,152 --> 02:28:33,047
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1760
02:28:33,071 --> 02:28:35,466
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

1761
02:28:35,490 --> 02:28:37,802
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

1762
02:28:37,826 --> 02:28:40,078
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1763
02:28:40,161 --> 02:28:41,997
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1764
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:45,083
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

1765
02:28:45,166 --> 02:28:46,656
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1766
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:55,299
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

1767
02:28:55,385 --> 02:28:57,672
Please! I just need your attention!

1768
02:29:13,570 --> 02:29:14,685
You're okay!

1769
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:48,237
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1770
02:30:48,331 --> 02:30:49,537
Follow me, sir.

1771
02:32:59,545 --> 02:33:01,035
No, no. It's okay.

1772
02:33:01,130 --> 02:33:02,165
It's okay.

1773
02:33:03,341 --> 02:33:04,376
It's okay.

1774
02:33:06,010 --> 02:33:08,126
It's done now. It's done.

1775
02:33:10,848 --> 02:33:12,179
It's over.

1776
02:34:08,030 --> 02:34:11,489
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1777
02:34:12,201 --> 02:34:14,533
Take it easy. Easy.

1778
02:34:43,107 --> 02:34:44,222
Jesus.

1779
02:34:54,076 --> 02:34:55,737
Who the hell are you?

1780
02:34:59,957 --> 02:35:00,957
Me?

1781
02:35:04,128 --> 02:35:05,539
I'm Vengeance.

1782
02:38:38,009 --> 02:38:40,296
<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

1783
02:38:43,514 --> 02:38:45,380
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

1784
02:38:47,727 --> 02:38:49,468
<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

1785
02:38:51,772 --> 02:38:53,763
<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

1786
02:38:54,692 --> 02:38:56,592
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

1787
02:38:59,530 --> 02:39:03,239
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

1788
02:39:03,325 --> 02:39:05,862
<i>in the parts of the city
no one can get to.</i>

1789
02:39:07,038 --> 02:39:10,747
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

1790
02:39:13,711 --> 02:39:16,829
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

1791
02:39:18,215 --> 02:39:19,580
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

1792
02:39:20,217 --> 02:39:21,673
But not just our city.

1793
02:39:22,386 --> 02:39:26,596
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

1794
02:39:26,682 --> 02:39:30,137
In our elected officials, In each other.

1795
02:39:30,936 --> 02:39:34,270
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1796
02:39:38,611 --> 02:39:40,272
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1797
02:39:41,739 --> 02:39:43,901
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

1798
02:39:45,993 --> 02:39:47,904
<i>but not the one I intended.</i>

1799
02:39:50,289 --> 02:39:53,327
<i>Vengeance won't change the past,</i>

1800
02:39:54,668 --> 02:39:57,035
<i>mine or anyone else's.</i>

1801
02:39:59,465 --> 02:40:01,502
<i>I have to become more.</i>

1802
02:40:04,595 --> 02:40:06,211
<i>People need hope.</i>

1803
02:40:07,431 --> 02:40:09,638
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

1804
02:40:13,437 --> 02:40:15,098
<i>The city's angry,</i>

1805
02:40:16,023 --> 02:40:17,388
<i>scarred,</i>

1806
02:40:18,317 --> 02:40:19,557
<i>like me.</i>

1807
02:40:21,695 --> 02:40:23,777
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1808
02:40:25,157 --> 02:40:27,865
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

1809
02:40:29,495 --> 02:40:31,236
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

1810
02:40:32,748 --> 02:40:34,614
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1811
02:40:36,502 --> 02:40:38,413
<i>They can give us the power</i>

1812
02:40:39,380 --> 02:40:40,870
<i>to endure...</i>

1813
02:40:42,258 --> 02:40:44,374
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

1814
02:40:47,304 --> 02:40:49,466
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

1815
02:40:49,557 --> 02:40:52,345
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

1816
02:40:52,434 --> 02:40:54,016
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

1817
02:40:54,103 --> 02:40:55,789
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

1818
02:40:55,813 --> 02:40:58,816
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

1819
02:40:58,899 --> 02:41:01,436
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

1820
02:41:01,527 --> 02:41:03,922
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

1821
02:41:03,946 --> 02:41:06,404
Isn't that just terrible?

1822
02:41:07,783 --> 02:41:12,652
Him... raining on
your parade like that?

1823
02:41:18,377 --> 02:41:20,368
What is it they say?

1824
02:41:21,547 --> 02:41:23,709
"One day you're on top,

1825
02:41:25,259 --> 02:41:26,920
the next...

1826
02:41:28,304 --> 02:41:30,215
you're a clown."

1827
02:41:32,600 --> 02:41:33,761
Well,

1828
02:41:35,561 --> 02:41:38,394
Let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

1829
02:41:40,691 --> 02:41:43,353
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1830
02:41:44,653 --> 02:41:46,485
You did so well.

1831
02:41:50,993 --> 02:41:51,993
And you know,

1832
02:41:53,662 --> 02:41:56,871
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1833
02:42:06,926 --> 02:42:08,291
Who are you?

1834
02:42:08,844 --> 02:42:11,256
Well, that's the question,

1835
02:42:12,514 --> 02:42:13,675
isn't it?

1836
02:42:16,602 --> 02:42:18,969
Riddle me this...

1837
02:42:21,440 --> 02:42:23,556
"The less of them you have,

1838
02:42:24,318 --> 02:42:28,152
the more one is worth."

1839
02:42:33,577 --> 02:42:35,318
A friend.

1840
02:43:01,563 --> 02:43:02,963
You're leaving.

1841
02:43:03,482 --> 02:43:04,563
Jesus.

1842
02:43:06,318 --> 02:43:07,900
Don't you ever just say hello?

1843
02:43:12,992 --> 02:43:14,403
Where will you go?

1844
02:43:15,911 --> 02:43:18,323
I don't know. Upstate.

1845
02:43:18,747 --> 02:43:20,454
Bludhaven, maybe.

1846
02:43:21,333 --> 02:43:22,333
Why?

1847
02:43:23,544 --> 02:43:24,750
You asking me to stay?

1848
02:43:31,802 --> 02:43:33,918
You know this place is never gonna change.

1849
02:43:34,346 --> 02:43:36,682
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

1850
02:43:36,765 --> 02:43:38,676
There's gonna be a power grab.

1851
02:43:40,311 --> 02:43:41,426
It'll be bloody.

1852
02:43:42,062 --> 02:43:43,268
I know.

1853
02:43:44,815 --> 02:43:45,900
But the city can change.

1854
02:43:45,983 --> 02:43:47,223
It won't.

1855
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:49,360
I have to try.

1856
02:43:49,445 --> 02:43:51,695
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

1857
02:43:53,532 --> 02:43:54,647
Listen.

1858
02:43:57,077 --> 02:43:58,427
Why don't you come with me?

1859
02:43:59,288 --> 02:44:00,778
Get into some trouble.

1860
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:05,033
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

1861
02:44:05,711 --> 02:44:07,327
The bat and the cat.

1862
02:44:08,839 --> 02:44:10,500
It's got a nice ring.

1863
02:44:23,854 --> 02:44:25,265
Who am I kidding?

1864
02:44:26,732 --> 02:44:28,848
You're already spoken for.

1865
02:44:40,746 --> 02:44:42,157
You should go.

1866
02:44:50,506 --> 02:44:51,506
Selina...

1867
02:44:55,594 --> 02:44:57,255
Take care of yourself.

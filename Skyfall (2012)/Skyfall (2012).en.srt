1
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:28,089
Ronson's down.

2
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:29,758
He needs medical evac.

3
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,635
<i>Where is it? Is it there?</i>

4
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:32,677
Hard drive's gone.

5
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:34,679
<i>Are you sure?</i>

6
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:39,643
It's gone. Give me a minute.

7
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:41,686
<i>They must have it.
Get after them.</i>

8
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:47,716
I'm stabilizing Ronson.

9
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,027
<i>We don't have the time.</i>

10
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:50,695
I have to stop the bleeding!

11
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,781
<i>Leave him!</i>

12
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:28,817
Have you got him?

13
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,777
He's in the black Audi.

14
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:32,696
What about Ronson?

15
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:33,863
He's been hit.

16
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,074
We're sending an emergency
evacuation squad.

17
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,784
They'll be too bloody late!

18
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:40,453
He's seen us.

19
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:43,096
Medical evac for Ronson five minutes away.

20
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:51,404
That's all right.
You weren't using it.

21
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,760
I wasn't using that one, either.

22
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,474
Keep your head down.

23
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:18,635
Just get clear!

24
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,222
Tanner, which way?

25
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,057
Keep going.
I can direct you from here.

26
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,726
You both know what's at stake here.

27
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,394
We can't afford to lose that list.

28
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:28,478
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:04:58,383 --> 00:04:59,634
<i>Where are they now?</i>

30
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,367
They appear to be on the
rooftops of the Grand Bazaar.

31
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,730
Take a left. There's a bridge.
You can cut him off.

32
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,723
Down, sir!

33
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,579
- What happened?
- They're on the train, ma'am.

34
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:51,913
<i>What do you mean on the train?</i>

35
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,316
I mean, they're on top of a train.

36
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:55,223
Well, get after them, for God's sake!

37
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:26,698
She's going out of range.

38
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,273
We've lost tracking.
We're blind here.

39
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:30,202
- What's going on?
<i>- I'm still with them.</i>

40
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:32,370
Get me CCTV, satellite, anything!

41
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:23,671
<i>What was that?</i>

42
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,256
VW Beetles.

43
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,924
I think.

44
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,535
Bond!
He's uncoupling the cars.

45
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,325
<i>007, are you all right?</i>

46
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,494
Just changing carriages.

47
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,081
<i>What's going on? Report!</i>

48
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,956
It's rather hard to explain, ma'am.

49
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,709
<i>007's still in pursuit.</i>

50
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,318
Looks like there isn't much more road.

51
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,403
I don't think I can go any further.

52
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,439
I may have a shot.

53
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:36,781
It's not clean.

54
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,781
<i>Repeat, I do not have a clean shot.</i>

55
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:48,107
There's a tunnel ahead.
I'm gonna lose them.

56
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:49,878
Can you get into a better position?

57
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:51,504
Negative. There's no time.

58
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,632
Take the shot.

59
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:57,927
<i>I said take the shot.</i>

60
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:00,972
I can't! I may hit Bond.

61
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,306
Take the bloody shot!

62
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:27,038

It's like being summoned
to the headmaster's study.

109
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,905
It's a new Chairman.
Just standard procedure.

110
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,157
Bloody waste of my time is what I call it.

111
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:55,326
I'm sorry to have to deal with such

112
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:57,551
a delicate subject at our first encounter.

113
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,498
But, um...

114
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,834
I have to be frank with you.

115
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,003
I think that would be a good idea.

116
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:11,050
The Prime Minister's concerned.

117
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,762
Well, you can tell him my operatives
are pursuing every avenue.

118
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,848
Have you considered
pulling out the agents?

119
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:18,349
I've considered every option.

120
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,768
Forgive me, that sounds like an evasion.

121
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:22,853
Forgive me, but why am I here?

122
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:27,942
Three months ago, you lost the
computer drive containing the identity

123
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,527
of almost every NATO agent embedded in

124
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:33,072
terrorist organizations across the globe.

125
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,575
A list which, in the eyes of
our allies, never existed.

126
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:40,579
So if you'll forgive me,
I think you know why you're here.

127
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,665
Are we to call this "civilian oversight"?

128
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:46,210
No, we're to call
this "retirement planning."

129
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,964
Your country has only the
highest respect for you

130
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,049
and your many years of service.

131
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:54,009
When your current posting is completed,

132
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,221
you'll be awarded GCMG with full honors.

133
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,391
Congratulations.

134
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,267
You're firing me.

135
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,854
No, ma'am, I'm here to
oversee the transition period

136
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:07,737
leading to your voluntary
retirement in two months' time.

137
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,651
Your successor has yet to be
appointed, so we'll be asking you...

138
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,444
I'm not an idiot, Mallory.

139
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:15,239
I know I can't do this job forever

140
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,648
but I'll be damned if I'm
going to leave the department

141
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,660
in worse shape than I found it.

142
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,329
M, you've had a great run.

143
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,497
You should leave with dignity.

144
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,751
Oh, to hell with dignity.
I'll leave when the job's done.

145
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:47,980
Yes?

146
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:50,649
Now?

147
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:56,613
Ma'am, alert from Q-Branch. Someone's
trying to decrypt the stolen hard drive.

148
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,116
We're tracing the encryption signal.

149
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,784
Localizing now.

150
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,289
Centering in the UK.

151
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,709
London.

152
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:11,043
Get us back to base as soon as possible.

153
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,303
It's coming from MI6.

154
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,637
What?

155
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,931
The data packet is linking to our network.

156
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,642
Correction.
This is behind our firewall.

157
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,310
We should shut down.

158
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,353
No, track it.

159
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,762
We have to know where it's coming from.

160
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,731
Strip the headers.
Trace the source.

161
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,916
How the hell did they get into our system?

162
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,487
Getting trace back now.

163
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,659
It appears...

164
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,061
It appears to be your computer, ma'am.

165
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:47,498
Shut it down.

166
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,671
What is this?

167
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,028
For God's sake!

168
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,573
Just get out of the way!

169
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,349
- Don't you recognize the car?
- Madam.

170
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,805
Oh...!

171
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,521
<i>This is CNN Breaking News.</i>

172
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,190
<i>Emergency crews are still
attempting to assess</i>

173
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,693
<i>the damage as investigators hunt for leads</i>

174
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,903
<i>in what now appears to be a major</i>

175
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,114
<i>terrorist attack in the heart of London.</i>

176
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,990
<i>No-one has yet claimed responsibility
for what sources are calling</i>

177
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,373
<i>a possible "cyber-terrorist assault"
on the British Secret Service.</i>

178
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,750
<i>Early reports from the scene indicate</i>

179
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,086
<i>at least six dead, many more injured,</i>

180

181
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,133
{\an8}<i>within minutes of the explosion.</i>

182
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,320
It's time to go, ma'am.

183
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,575
I'm going to find whoever did this.

184
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,542
Where the hell have you been?

185
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,295
Enjoying death.

186
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,216
007 reporting for duty.

187
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,183
Why didn't you call?

188
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,644
You didn't get the postcard?

189
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,011
You should try it some time.
Get away from it all.

190
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,856
It really lends perspective.

191
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,443
Ran out of drink where you were, did they?

192
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,152
What was it you said?

193
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,655
"Take the bloody shot."

194
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,198
I made a judgment call.

195
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,826
You should have trusted me
to finish the job.

196
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:17,828
It was the possibility of losing you

197
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,497
or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.

198
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,500
I made the only decision
I could and you know it.

199
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:25,919
I think you lost your nerve.

200
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,422
What do you expect, a bloody apology?

201
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,257
You know the rules of the game.

202
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,800
You've been playing it long enough.

203
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:32,884
We both have.

204
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,095
Maybe too long.

205
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,431
Speak for yourself.

206
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,018
Ronson didn't make it, did he?

207
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,187
No.

208
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,025
So this is it.

209
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:51,445
We're both played out.

210
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,762
Well, if you believe that,
why did you come back?

211
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,366
Good question.

212
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,953
Because we're under attack.

213
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:03,957
And you know we need you.

214
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,463
Well, I'm here.

215
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:14,801
You'll have to be debriefed and
declared fit for active service.

216
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,805
You can only return to duty
when you've passed the tests,

217
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,223
so take them seriously.

218
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,809
And a shower might be in order.

219
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,061
I'll go home and change.

220
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:29,232
Oh, we've sold your flat,
put your things into storage.

221
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:33,403
Standard procedure on the
death of an unmarried employee

222
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,780
with no next of kin.

223
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:37,574
You should have called.

224
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,451
I'll find a hotel.

225
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,078
Well, you're bloody
well not sleeping here.

226
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:12,609
The assailant hacked into
the environmental control system,

227
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,277
locked out the safety protocols

228
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:17,781
and turned on the gas, all of
which should have been impossible.

229
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,283
On top of that,
they hacked into her files.

230
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,745
They knew her appointments,
knew she'd be out of the building.

231
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,622
They weren't targeting her.

232
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:28,208
They wanted her to see it.

233
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:30,919
Where are we, Tanner?

234
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,337
New digs.

235
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,390
The old building was declared
"strategically vulnerable".

236
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,642
That's putting it mildly.

237
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,145
He was able to breach the most
secure computer system in Britain.

238
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:51,022
So we're on war footing now.

239
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,025
This was part of Churchill's bunker.

240
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:55,777
We're still discovering tunnels

241
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,237
dating back to the 18th Century.

242
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,656
Quite fascinating,
if it wasn't for the rats.

243
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,324
When do I see M?

244
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,869
Tomorrow you'll see M and
Mallory, too, if you're lucky.

245
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,162
Who's Mallory?

246
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:08,999
The new Chairman of the
Intelligence and Security Committee.

247
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,240
Charming man.
I think you and he

248
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,800
are really going to hit it off.

249
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,922
Welcome to the new MI6.

250
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:35,066
We've attempted to trace
the computer message, but

251
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:38,194
it was sent by an asymmetrical
security algorithm,

252
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:39,936
which bounced the signal
all over the globe

253
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,949
through over a thousand different servers.

254
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,784
And now that they've accessed M's codes,

255
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,537
it's only a matter of time before
they're able to decrypt the list.

256
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,570
Q-Branch have been analyzing
the picture but so far nothing.

257
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,543
The general feeling is it's
probably someone from her past.

258
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:55,211
Perhaps when she was
running things in Hong Kong.

259
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:56,755
She's no idea what it all means.

260
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:57,964
You believe that?

261
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,681
The truth is, we don't
have a clue who took the list

262
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,553
or what they plan to do with it.

263
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:11,793
We can always do this later.

264
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:15,607
You know what? Let's.

265
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,635
I'd like to start with some
simple word associations.

266
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,221
Just tell me the first word
that pops into your head.

267
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,724
For example, I might say "Day"
and you might say...

268
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:31,808
Wasted.

269
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,397
All right.

270
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,111
Gun.

271
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:46,197
- Shot.
- Agent.

272
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:47,699
Provocateur.

273
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:48,783
Woman.

274
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:49,826
Provocatrix.

275
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,035
Heart.

276
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,162
Target.

277
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:54,372
Bird.

278
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:55,707
Sky.

279
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:56,916
M.

280
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,084
Bitch.

281
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:01,588
Sunlight.

282
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:02,839
Swim.

283
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,674
- Moonlight.
- Dance.

284
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,009
Murder.

285
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:07,427
Employment.

286
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:09,721
- Country.
- England.

287
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:11,264
Skyfall.

288
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:18,104
Skyfall.

289
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:22,776
Done.

290
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:31,034
Well, this is going well.

291
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:20,667
Get these analyzed.

292
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,253
For her eyes only.

293
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,283
She's ready for you.

294
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,869
I'm sorry, have we met before?

295
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:58,788
I'm the one who should say "sorry".

296
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,876
It was only four ribs.

297
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,378
Some of the less vital organs.

298
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,590
Nothing major.

299
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,639
Not enough excitement in Istanbul?

300
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,307
I've been reassigned.

301
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,475
Temporary suspension from field work.

302
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:21,102
- Really?
- Mmm.

303
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,812
Something to do with killing 007.

304
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:24,939
Well, you gave it your best shot.

305
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:26,816
That was hardly my best shot.

306
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,235
I'm not sure I could survive your best.

307
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:31,154
I doubt you'll get the chance.

308
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:35,021
Well, do me a favor, will you?
If they do ever let you back out there,

309
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,327
warn me first.

310
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,663
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition,

311
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,665
and then I'll be back in the field.

312
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,500
That's what you want?

313
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,085
Yes, of course.

314
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,837
It's not for everyone.

315
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:50,256
Ah, 007. It's this way.

316
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:55,762
In your defense,
a moving target is much harder to hit.

317
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,432
Then you better keep moving.

318
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:11,861
The whole office goes up in smoke

319
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:13,738
and that bloody thing survives.

320
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:17,742
Your interior decorating tips
have always been appreciated, 007.

321
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,079
007, Gareth Mallory.

322
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:22,664
I hope I haven't missed anything.

323
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:24,374
The PM does prattle on in a crisis.

324
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:25,458
Bond.

325
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:26,960
Mallory.

326
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:34,592
I've just been reviewing Bond's tests.

327
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:38,221
It seems you've passed...
by the skin of your teeth.

328
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:40,431
You're back on active service.

329
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:42,517
Congratulations.

330
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:43,768
Thank you.

331
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:45,603
I'll, um...

332
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:46,813
I'll be outside.

333
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,148
I only have one question.

334
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,734
Why not stay dead?

335
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:56,447
You have the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly somewhere.

336
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:59,826
Not many field agents get
to leave this cleanly.

337
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:01,726
Do you get out in the field much?

338
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:06,332
You don't need to be an
operative to see the obvious.

339
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,960
It's a young man's game.

340
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,755
Look, you've been seriously injured.

341
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,173
There's no shame in saying
you've lost a step.

342
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:17,507
The only shame would be not
admitting it until it's too late.

343
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:21,347
Hire me or fire me.
It's entirely up to you.

344
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,434
If he says he's ready, he's ready.

345
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,021
Perhaps you can't see it,
or maybe you won't.

346
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,814
What exactly are you implying?

347
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,890
You're sentimental about him.

348
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:36,988
As long as I'm head of this department,
I'll choose my own operatives.

349
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,034
Fair enough.

350
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:47,206
Good luck, 007.

351
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:50,043
Don't cock it up.

352
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,885
We've analyzed the shrapnel fragments.

353
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:01,329
You're lucky it wasn't a direct hit

354
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:02,806
or it would have cut you in half.

355
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:06,142
It's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.

356
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:09,187
Hard to get, extremely expensive,

357
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:11,981
and only used by a select few.

358
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,317
Recognize anyone?

359
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,236
Him.

360
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,656
Okay. Name's Patrice.

361
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:23,243
He's a ghost. No known
residence or country of origin.

362
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,911
So how do we find him?

363
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:28,247
Well, luckily, we still have one
or two friends left in the CIA.

364
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,281
They're after him for the
Yemeni ambassador's murder,

365
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,043
and they're getting close.

366
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,185
Intel is he's going to be in Shanghai

367
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,095
in two days time, probably on a job.

368
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,967
You're to go there and
await further instructions.

369
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,927
If he turns up, he's yours.

370
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:44,388
Find out who he works for
and who has the list.

371
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,557
Then terminate him, for Ronson.

372
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,184
With pleasure.

373
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:51,452
Is there anything
else you want to tell me?

374
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:53,648
No.

375
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:57,557
Report to the new Quartermaster
for your documentation.

376
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,113
He hasn't set up shop yet, but Tanner will

377
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:02,198
put you two together.
Good luck.

378
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:04,450
Thank you.

379
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,996
007.

380
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,209
You are ready for this?

381
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,628
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:21,717
I didn't know Bond passed the tests.

383
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,553
He didn't.

384
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,543
Always makes me feel a little melancholy.

385
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:59,463
A grand old warship being
ignominiously hauled away for scrap.

386
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,052
The inevitability of time,
don't you think?

387
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:09,056
What do you see?

388
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,685
A bloody big ship.

389
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,021
Excuse me.

390
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,772
007...

391
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,359
I'm your new Quartermaster.

392
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:23,779
You must be joking.

393
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:25,990
Why, because I'm not wearing a lab coat?

394
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,117
Because you still have spots.

395
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,953
My complexion is hardly relevant.

396
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:33,039
Well, your competence is.

397
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,833
Age is no guarantee of efficiency.

398
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,711
And youth is no guarantee of innovation.

399
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:40,880
I'll hazard I can do more damage

400
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:42,549
on my laptop sitting in my pajamas

401
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:44,258
before my first cup of Earl Grey

402
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,052
than you can do in a year in the field.

403
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,720
Oh, so why do you need me?

404
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,680
Every now and then
a trigger has to be pulled.

405
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,976
Or not pulled.

406
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:57,230
It's hard to know which in your pajamas.

407
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,818
Q.

408
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:04,695
007.

409
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,451
Ticket to Shanghai.

410
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:11,828
Documentation and passport.

411
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,120
Thank you.

412
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:14,372
And this.

413
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:20,753
Walther PPK/S 9mm short.

414
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:24,757
There's a micro-dermal sensor in the grip.

415
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:28,427
It's been coded to your palm
print so only you can fire it.

416
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,682
Less of a random killing machine,
more of a personal statement.

417
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:34,183
And this?

418
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,895
Standard issue radio transmitter.

419
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:41,899
Activate it and it
broadcasts your location.

420
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,818
Distress signal.

421
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:46,612
And that's it.

422
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,449
A gun...

423
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:52,618
...and a radio.

424
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:56,956
Not exactly Christmas, is it?

425
00:40:57,623 --> 00:41:00,209
Were you expecting an exploding pen?

426
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:03,879
We don't really go in for that anymore.

427
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,389
Good luck out there in the field.

428
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:16,976
And please return the
equipment in one piece.

429
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:23,899
Brave new world.

430
00:49:43,649 --> 00:49:45,108
Who's got the list?

431
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:52,366
Tell me!
Who are you working for?

432
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:24,499
Tanner... He's posted
the first five names.

433
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:27,717
Their cover's blown. They're
in danger. Get them out now.

434
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:09,419
Room service.

435
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:20,889
I didn't order anything.
Not even you.

436
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,891
I've got some new information.

437
00:52:24,101 --> 00:52:27,646
Aren't you a little overqualified
to be delivering messages?

438
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,399
It's all part of the learning curve.

439
00:52:30,983 --> 00:52:32,818
And Q's afraid of flying.

440
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:35,028
Of course he is.

441
00:52:35,404 --> 00:52:38,907
So whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.

442
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:42,077
They posted the first
five names on the web.

443
00:52:42,494 --> 00:52:44,454
Well, it was only a matter of time.

444
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,039
Well, that's just the start.

445
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:49,084
They're posting five more next
week, and the week after.

446
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:51,878
It's some kind of sadistic game.

447
00:52:57,092 --> 00:52:58,927
Cut-throat razor.

448
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:02,264
How very traditional.

449
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:06,268
Well, I like to do some things
the old-fashioned way.

450
00:53:09,104 --> 00:53:11,565
Sometimes the old ways are the best.

451
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,786
Are you putting your life
in my hands again?

452
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,457
M's...

453
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:31,793
...already
briefed me on the list.

454
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:35,130
Raising the tantalizing question

455
00:53:35,297 --> 00:53:37,299
of what you're really doing here.

456
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:41,053
My official directive was to help...

457
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:44,806
"in any way I can."

458
00:53:46,308 --> 00:53:48,977
Like spying for Mallory.

459
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:53,648
You know, Mallory's not as bad
as you think.

460
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:56,651
He's a bureaucrat.

461
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:59,446
You should do your homework.

462
00:54:00,155 --> 00:54:02,616
Gareth Mallory was a Lieutenant Colonel...

463
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:05,494
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern
Ireland, Hereford Regiment.

464
00:54:05,577 --> 00:54:08,038
Spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.

465
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:12,501
So there's more to him than meets the eye.

466
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:16,505
We'll see.

467
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:19,841
Keep still.

468
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:24,346
This is the tricky part.

469
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,859
Now that's better.

470
00:54:39,111 --> 00:54:40,237
You look the part now.

471
00:54:40,654 --> 00:54:42,364
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

472
00:54:43,824 --> 00:54:45,659
And what part's that?

473
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:49,204
Old dog,

474
00:54:50,372 --> 00:54:52,207
new tricks.

475
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:05,614
Good evening.

476
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:07,157
<i>Evening.</i>

477
00:56:07,324 --> 00:56:09,117
Don't touch your ear.

478
00:56:10,452 --> 00:56:12,454
I've got three exits,

479
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:15,290
lots of blind spots.

480
00:56:15,832 --> 00:56:17,459
I've got them covered.

481
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:25,800
You look beautiful in that dress.

482
00:56:25,926 --> 00:56:27,594
<i>You don't scrub up so bad yourself.</i>

483
00:56:27,677 --> 00:56:30,639
It's amazing what one can do
with an extra pair of hands.

484
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:32,807
<i>You're telling me.</i>

485
00:56:34,476 --> 00:56:36,186
Do you gamble?

486
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:38,161
<i>I like a little flutter now and then.</i>

487
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:43,151
Who doesn't like to take chances?

488
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,492
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

489
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:52,661
I'd like to cash this in, please.

490
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:00,669
One moment, sir.

491
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:34,703
Good fortune tonight, sir.

492
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,377
Let's hope so.

493
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:53,054
With compliments of the house.

494
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:54,889
Thank you.

495
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,580
Now you can afford to buy me a drink.

496
00:58:20,749 --> 00:58:23,084
Maybe I'll even stretch to two.

497
00:58:24,294 --> 00:58:26,755
I'm guessing I've got four
million euros in here.

498
00:58:27,213 --> 00:58:29,716
Not bad. I like this game.

499
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:31,968
Why don't we play another?

500
00:58:33,303 --> 00:58:35,096
I don't gamble.

501
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,101
I'm not very lucky.

502
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:42,437
A little like our friend in Shanghai.

503
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:49,778
I've been waiting to see
who would redeem the chip.

504
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:53,656
You made such a bold entrance
into our little drama.

505
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:56,076
Did I over-complicate the plot?

506
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,288
Who doesn't appreciate
the occasional twist, Mr...?

507
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:02,207
Bond.

508
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,583
James Bond.

509
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,127
Severine.

510
00:59:06,336 --> 00:59:10,965
So, Mr. Bond, shall we discuss your
next performance over that drink?

511
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:13,134
I'd like that.

512
00:59:16,137 --> 00:59:18,306
Will your friends be joining us?

513
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:23,144
That, I'm afraid, is inevitable.

514
00:59:26,523 --> 00:59:27,690
<i>She's pretty.</i>

515
00:59:27,816 --> 00:59:29,025
Now, now.

516
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:31,319
<i>If you like that sort of thing.</i>

517
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,696
I'll keep you posted.

518
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,668
Perfect.

519
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:52,215
Would you mind if I asked
you a business question?

520
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:54,843
Depends on the question.

521
00:59:55,677 --> 00:59:58,054
It has to do with death.

522
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:02,392
A subject in which you're well-versed.

523
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,352
And how would you know that?

524
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:08,565
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress

525
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,901
with a Beretta 70 strapped to her thigh.

526
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,113
One can never be too careful when

527
01:00:15,238 --> 01:00:18,032
handsome men in tuxedos carry Walthers.

528
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:23,413
I am correct in
assuming you killed Patrice?

529
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:25,874
Yes.

530
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:29,419
Might I ask why?

531
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:32,422
I want to meet your employer.

532
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:47,228
Be careful what you wish for.

533
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,356
You're scared.

534
01:00:51,608 --> 01:00:53,109
Thank you for the drink,

535
01:00:55,278 --> 01:00:56,738
Mr. Bond.

536
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:06,581
You put on a good show.

537
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,752
But ever since we sat down,
you haven't stopped

538
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:12,795
looking at your bodyguards.

539
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:16,799
Now, three of them is a bit excessive.

540
01:01:17,634 --> 01:01:20,720
They're controlling you.
They're not protecting you.

541
01:01:23,223 --> 01:01:26,142
The tattoo on your wrist
is Macau sex trade.

542
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:30,772
You belonged to one of the houses.
What were you? 12? 13?

543
01:01:32,607 --> 01:01:34,484
I'm guessing he was your way out.

544
01:01:35,777 --> 01:01:37,946
Perhaps you thought you were in love.

545
01:01:39,656 --> 01:01:41,824
But that was a long time ago.

546
01:01:44,244 --> 01:01:46,287
You know nothing about it.

547
01:01:46,788 --> 01:01:49,958
I know when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.

548
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:55,338
How much do you know about fear?

549
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:57,674
All there is.

550
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,802
Not like this.

551
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:04,973
Not like him.

552
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,850
I can help you.

553
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:09,978
I don't think so.

554
01:02:10,103 --> 01:02:11,145
Let me try.

555
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:14,983
How?

556
01:02:16,276 --> 01:02:17,819
Bring me to him.

557
01:02:20,697 --> 01:02:21,656
Can you kill him?

558
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:22,824
Yes.

559
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:25,493
Will you?

560
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:27,996
Someone usually dies.

561
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,544
Perhaps you can.

562
01:02:42,677 --> 01:02:44,971
When I leave, they're going to kill you.

563
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:49,976
If you survive, I'm on the <i>Chimera.</i>
North harbor.

564
01:02:50,977 --> 01:02:52,562
Berth seven.

565
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:56,065
We cast off in an hour.

566
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:03,573
Very nice to have met you,
Mr. Bond.

567
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:06,743
Good luck.

568
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:34,205
Good luck with that.

569
01:04:58,855 --> 01:04:59,981
Thank you.

570
01:05:05,153 --> 01:05:06,279
Put it all on red.

571
01:05:09,157 --> 01:05:10,825
It's the circle of life.

572
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:36,142
Yes!

573
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:41,898
It's time to cast off.

574
01:05:43,816 --> 01:05:45,026
All right.

575
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:43,417
I like you better without your Beretta.

576
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:48,756
I feel naked without it.

577
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:07,149
<i>Good evening.</i>

578
01:07:07,275 --> 01:07:10,737
<i>The controversy surrounding the
Ministry of Defence has escalated today</i>

579
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:14,490
<i>as images of the Husein
assassination continue to circulate.</i>

580
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:16,576
<i>We should warn you, some viewers</i>

581
01:07:16,701 --> 01:07:18,452
<i>might find these images disturbing.</i>

582
01:07:19,954 --> 01:07:23,124
{\an8}<i>Captain Husein, an MI6 operative
embedded in the Middle East,</i>

583
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:25,209
{\an8}<i>was one of the five agents exposed</i>

584
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:27,128
{\an8}<i>in what is now being considered</i>

585
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:30,798
{\an8}<i>the greatest internal security
breach in modern British history.</i>

586
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:34,969
{\an8}<i>The Prime Minister continues to
express public support for MI6</i>

587
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:37,344
{\an8}<i>while the opposition has taken
the position...</i>

588
01:07:37,513 --> 01:07:40,033
Has taken the position we're a
bunch of antiquated bloody idiots

589
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:43,144
fighting a war we don't
understand and can't possibly win.

590
01:07:43,603 --> 01:07:45,438
Look, three of my agents are dead already.

591
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:47,356
Don't embroil me in politics now.

592
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:50,902
The Prime Minister's ordered an inquiry.
You'll have to appear.

593
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:54,238
Oh, standing in the stocks at midday?
Who's antiquated now?

594
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:56,647
For Christ's sake, listen to yourself.
We're a democracy,

595
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:59,327
accountable to the people
we're trying to defend.

596
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:02,518
We can't keep working in the shadows.
There are no more shadows.

597
01:08:02,872 --> 01:08:04,415
You don't get this, do you?

598
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:08,878
Whoever's behind this,
whoever's doing it, he knows us.

599
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:12,256
He's one of us. He comes
from the same place as Bond.

600
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:14,398
The place you say doesn't exist.

601
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:17,178
The shadows.

602
01:08:54,507 --> 01:08:57,343
It's not too late.
We could turn back now.

603
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:05,851
I wouldn't be so sure.

604
01:09:43,556 --> 01:09:45,975
They abandoned it almost overnight.

605
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:50,396
He made them think there was
a leak at the chemical plant.

606
01:09:52,106 --> 01:09:55,109
It's amazing the panic you can
cause with a single computer.

607
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:00,114
He wanted the island, so he took it.

608
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:04,285
Does he always get what he wants?

609
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:06,746
More than you know.

610
01:10:09,957 --> 01:10:11,125
I'm sorry.

611
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,947
Hello, James. Welcome.

612
01:10:43,157 --> 01:10:44,825
Do you like the island?

613
01:10:48,037 --> 01:10:49,705
My grandmother had an island.

614
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:53,375
Nothing to boast of.
You could walk around it in an hour.

615
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:56,545
But still, it was,
it was a paradise for us.

616
01:10:57,379 --> 01:10:59,673
One summer, we went for a visit

617
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,803
and discovered the place
had been infested with rats!

618
01:11:04,178 --> 01:11:08,390
They'd come on a fishing boat
and gorged themselves on coconut.

619
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:11,227
So how do you get
rats off an island? Hmm?

620
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:13,896
My grandmother showed me.

621
01:11:14,814 --> 01:11:17,525
We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid,

622
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,902
then wired coconut to the lid as bait.

623
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:22,402
And the rats would
come for the coconut and...

624
01:11:23,864 --> 01:11:25,699
...they would
fall into the drum.

625
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:29,912
And after a month,
you have trapped all the rats.

626
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:32,581
But what do you do then?

627
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,543
Throw the drum into the ocean?

628
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:38,546
Burn it? No.

629
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:40,923
You just leave it.

630
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:44,260
And they begin to get hungry.

631
01:11:45,094 --> 01:11:46,887
And one by one...

632
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:50,891
...they start eating each other

633
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,395
until there are only two left.
The two survivors.

634
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:57,189
And then what?
Do you kill them? No.

635
01:11:57,898 --> 01:12:01,110
You take them and release them
into the trees.

636
01:12:01,569 --> 01:12:04,280
But now they don't eat coconut anymore.

637
01:12:04,613 --> 01:12:06,949
Now they only eat rat.

638
01:12:08,576 --> 01:12:10,953
You have changed their nature.

639
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:14,331
The two survivors,

640
01:12:15,207 --> 01:12:16,834
this is what she made us.

641
01:12:19,587 --> 01:12:21,630
I made my own choices.

642
01:12:21,922 --> 01:12:24,008
You think you did.

643
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:26,594
That's her genius.

644
01:12:28,971 --> 01:12:32,516
Station H.
Am I right? Hong Kong.

645
01:12:32,808 --> 01:12:33,809
Mm-hmm.

646
01:12:34,268 --> 01:12:36,437
'86 to '97.

647
01:12:37,146 --> 01:12:39,398
Back then, I was her favorite.

648
01:12:39,565 --> 01:12:43,068
And you're not nearly the agent I
was, I can tell you that.

649
01:12:44,737 --> 01:12:49,241
Just look at you, barely held
together by your pills and your drink.

650
01:12:49,325 --> 01:12:51,375
Don't forget my pathetic love of country.

651
01:12:53,454 --> 01:12:56,790
You're still clinging to
your faith in that old woman.

652
01:12:57,249 --> 01:12:59,627
- When all she does is lie to you.
- She never lied to me.

653
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,337
- No?
- No.

654
01:13:01,754 --> 01:13:03,923
What did you score in your
marksmanship evaluation?

655
01:13:04,006 --> 01:13:05,257
70.

656
01:13:06,675 --> 01:13:07,968
40.

657
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,431
Did she tell you the psychologist
cleared you for duty?

658
01:13:12,514 --> 01:13:14,850
- Yes.
- No. No.

659
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:27,780
Medical evaluation: Fail.
Physical evaluation: Failed.

660
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:30,282
Psychological evaluation:
"Alcohol"

661
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:32,618
"and substance
addiction indicated."

662
01:13:35,329 --> 01:13:37,790
"Pathological rejection of authority"

663
01:13:37,915 --> 01:13:40,334
"based on
unresolved childhood trauma."

664
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:48,676
"Subject is not approved for field duty"

665
01:13:48,801 --> 01:13:51,845
"and immediate suspension
from service advised."

666
01:13:52,179 --> 01:13:54,223
What is this if not betrayal?

667
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:58,352
She sent you after me knowing you're
not ready, knowing you'll likely die.

668
01:13:58,519 --> 01:14:01,021
Mommy was very bad!

669
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:05,567
Hmm?

670
01:14:22,584 --> 01:14:23,585
Ooh.

671
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:26,880
See what she's done to you?

672
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:30,884
Well, she never tied me to a chair.

673
01:14:31,218 --> 01:14:32,678
Her loss.

674
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:38,726
Are you sure this is about M?

675
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:40,185
It's about her.

676
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,397
And you, and me.

677
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:47,401
You see, we are the last two rats.

678
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:49,862
We can either eat each other...

679
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:54,033
Hmm?

680
01:14:56,577 --> 01:14:58,454
...or eat everyone else.

681
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:04,752
How you're trying to remember
your training now.

682
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:08,714
What's the regulation to cover this?

683
01:15:12,426 --> 01:15:15,596
Well, first time
for everything. Yes?

684
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,602
What makes you think
this is my first time?

685
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,897
Oh, Mr. Bond!

686
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:31,278
All that physical stuff...
So dull, so dull.

687
01:15:34,114 --> 01:15:35,366
Chasing spies...

688
01:15:35,657 --> 01:15:37,534
so old-fashioned!

689
01:15:40,954 --> 01:15:42,790
Your knees must be killing you.

690
01:15:47,586 --> 01:15:48,921
England.

691
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:51,799
The Empire! MI6!

692
01:15:52,341 --> 01:15:54,259
You're living in a ruin as well,

693
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:56,136
you just don't know it yet.

694
01:15:57,513 --> 01:16:01,975
At least here there are no old
ladies giving orders and no little...

695
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,103
Bip!

696
01:16:04,144 --> 01:16:06,647
Gadgets from those fools in Q-Branch.

697
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:14,196
If you wanted, you could pick
your own secret missions. As I do.

698
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:17,950
Name it.

699
01:16:18,826 --> 01:16:19,993
Name it.

700
01:16:22,871 --> 01:16:25,749
Destabilize a multinational
by manipulating stocks...

701
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:26,917
Bip. Easy.

702
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:31,338
Interrupt transmissions from
a spy satellite over Kabul...

703
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,631
Done.

704
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:37,302
Hmm. Rig an election in Uganda.
All to the highest bidder.

705
01:16:37,845 --> 01:16:40,013
Or a gas explosion in London.

706
01:16:41,223 --> 01:16:42,683
Just point and click.

707
01:16:43,058 --> 01:16:44,810
Well, everybody needs a hobby.

708
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:52,484
So what's yours?

709
01:16:55,154 --> 01:16:56,697
Resurrection.

710
01:17:00,534 --> 01:17:02,327
Let me show you something.

711
01:17:14,882 --> 01:17:16,884
Tells a story, doesn't it?

712
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:22,848
They left the island so quickly,

713
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,725
they couldn't decide what to take,

714
01:17:25,017 --> 01:17:26,935
what to leave, what was important.

715
01:17:27,227 --> 01:17:31,190
And seeing this every day reminds
me to focus on the essentials.

716
01:17:31,398 --> 01:17:35,068
There's nothing... nothing
superfluous in my life.

717
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,906
When a thing is redundant,
it is eliminated.

718
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:51,251
50-year-old Macallan.

719
01:17:51,793 --> 01:17:54,713
A particular favorite of
yours, I understand.

720
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,259
So, what's the toast?

721
01:18:02,054 --> 01:18:03,889
"To the women we love"?

722
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:05,432
Hmm.

723
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:16,109
Darling.

724
01:18:16,985 --> 01:18:19,780
Darling, your lovers are here.

725
01:18:25,285 --> 01:18:26,787
No, no, no, no.

726
01:18:27,329 --> 01:18:29,331
Stand up straight.
Keep still.

727
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:33,126
And whatever you do, don't lose your head.

728
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:34,670
Don't lose...

729
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:36,338
your head.

730
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,968
Don't lose your head.

731
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:44,763
Time to redeem your marksmanship scores.

732
01:18:46,306 --> 01:18:47,641
Let's see.

733
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:52,646
Who can be the first to knock
the glass from her head?

734
01:18:58,694 --> 01:19:01,488
And just to be sporting,
I'll let you go first.

735
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:22,009
Let's see who ends up on top.

736
01:19:35,022 --> 01:19:36,857
Oh, I can't believe it.

737
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:40,652
I can't believe it!
Did you really die that day?

738
01:19:41,653 --> 01:19:45,490
Is there any, any of the old 007 left?

739
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:55,375
My turn.

740
01:19:59,046 --> 01:20:01,882
I win.
What do you say to that?

741
01:20:04,718 --> 01:20:06,678
It's a waste of good Scotch.

742
01:20:18,065 --> 01:20:21,610
What are you going to do now?
Take me back to her? All on your own?

743
01:20:22,277 --> 01:20:24,071
Who says I'm on my own?

744
01:20:43,048 --> 01:20:45,425
It's the latest thing from Q-Branch.

745
01:20:45,926 --> 01:20:47,928
It's called a radio.

746
01:21:08,782 --> 01:21:11,118
All right, time to say hello.

747
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:46,153
You're smaller than I remember!

748
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:49,156
Whereas I barely remember you at all.

749
01:21:49,573 --> 01:21:52,659
Strange. For me,
it feels just like yesterday.

750
01:21:54,703 --> 01:21:56,037
Are you surprised?

751
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:59,583
Not particularly. But then you
always were a slippery one.

752
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:02,043
Maybe that's why you liked me so much.

753
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:03,879
You flatter yourself.

754
01:22:04,004 --> 01:22:05,505
No remorse.

755
01:22:07,883 --> 01:22:10,051
Just as I had imagined.

756
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:12,345
Regret is unprofessional.

757
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:20,688
"Regret is unprofessional."

758
01:22:20,771 --> 01:22:25,859
They kept me for five months in a
room with no air. They tortured me.

759
01:22:26,443 --> 01:22:29,029
And I protected your secrets.
I protected you.

760
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:33,450
But they made me suffer.
And suffer.

761
01:22:35,243 --> 01:22:37,037
And suffer.

762
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:40,040
Until I realized...

763
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:43,543
...it was you who betrayed me.

764
01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:46,546
You betrayed me.

765
01:22:47,798 --> 01:22:50,967
So, I had only one thing left.

766
01:22:52,928 --> 01:22:56,389
My cyanide capsule in my back left molar.

767
01:22:56,556 --> 01:22:59,059
You remember, right?

768
01:23:02,646 --> 01:23:05,232
So I broke the tooth and...

769
01:23:05,774 --> 01:23:07,734
...bit into the capsule.

770
01:23:08,485 --> 01:23:09,736
And it...

771
01:23:13,156 --> 01:23:15,909
It burned all my insides.

772
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:18,119
But I didn't die.

773
01:23:21,331 --> 01:23:24,084
Life clung to me like a disease.

774
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:29,756
And then...

775
01:23:29,965 --> 01:23:33,760
I understood why I had survived.

776
01:23:36,263 --> 01:23:39,933
I needed to look in
your eyes one last time.

777
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:44,938
Well, I hope it was worth it.

778
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:50,944
Mr. Silva, you're going to be
transferred to Belmarsh Prison

779
01:23:51,486 --> 01:23:53,947
where you'll be remanded in custody

780
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,782
until the Crown Prosecution Service

781
01:23:55,907 --> 01:23:57,659
deem you fit to stand trial for...

782
01:23:57,784 --> 01:23:59,953
Say my name. Say it.

783
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:02,122
My real name.

784
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:04,666
I know you remember it.

785
01:24:06,126 --> 01:24:08,128
Your name is on the memorial wall

786
01:24:08,253 --> 01:24:10,297
of the very building you attacked.

787
01:24:11,131 --> 01:24:12,799
I will have it struck off.

788
01:24:13,383 --> 01:24:17,721
Soon your past will be as
nonexistent as your future.

789
01:24:18,555 --> 01:24:20,640
I'll never see you again.

790
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:25,478
Do you know what it does to you?

791
01:24:27,814 --> 01:24:29,900
Hydrogen cyanide?

792
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:44,998
Look upon your work,

793
01:24:46,041 --> 01:24:47,334
Mother.

794
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:28,000
Let me know what you recover
from his computer.

795
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:31,544
Has he transmitted the lists? If
so, to whom? I want this resolved.

796
01:25:31,628 --> 01:25:32,712
Yes, ma'am.

797
01:25:39,135 --> 01:25:41,554
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.

798
01:25:42,222 --> 01:25:43,723
He was a brilliant agent.

799
01:25:44,724 --> 01:25:47,894
But he started operating beyond his
brief, hacking the Chinese.

800
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:52,649
The handover was coming up and they
were onto him, so I gave him up.

801
01:25:52,774 --> 01:25:55,902
I got six agents in return
and a peaceful transition.

802
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:59,177
We should go, ma'am.
Board of Inquiry begins in 30 minutes.

803
01:25:59,572 --> 01:26:01,658
I want to know what's on that computer.

804
01:26:14,462 --> 01:26:16,965
Now, looking at Silva's computer,

805
01:26:17,465 --> 01:26:21,428
it seems to me he's done a number
of slightly unusual things.

806
01:26:21,469 --> 01:26:24,472
He's established failsafe
protocols to wipe the memory

807
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:27,142
if there's any attempt
to access certain files.

808
01:26:27,976 --> 01:26:30,729
Only six people in the world could
program safeguards like that.

809
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:32,912
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?

810
01:26:33,648 --> 01:26:35,150
I invented them.

811
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:39,654
Right, then.

812
01:26:41,281 --> 01:26:44,159
Let's see what you've
got for us, Mr. Silva.

813
01:26:46,536 --> 01:26:47,954
We're in.

814
01:26:54,377 --> 01:26:56,921
Sir, what do you make of this?

815
01:27:02,052 --> 01:27:03,762
It's his Omega site.

816
01:27:04,804 --> 01:27:06,473
Most encrypted level he has.

817
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:12,145
Looks like obfuscated code
to conceal its true purpose.

818
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,607
Security through obscurity.

819
01:27:17,484 --> 01:27:20,028
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order?

820
01:27:21,196 --> 01:27:22,896
I'd like to begin the proceedings.

821
01:27:24,991 --> 01:27:27,660
We're gathered today
to address important issues

822
01:27:27,786 --> 01:27:30,330
concerning the future
of our national security.

823
01:27:36,377 --> 01:27:38,004
Going somewhere?

824
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:43,718
So you believe your stewardship
of MI6 during the recent crisis

825
01:27:43,843 --> 01:27:45,178
has been up to scratch?

826
01:27:45,553 --> 01:27:48,640
Well, I believe we have
apprehended the responsible party

827
01:27:48,765 --> 01:27:50,517
and are taking all necessary steps

828
01:27:50,642 --> 01:27:53,353
to ensure that the sensitive
information is contained.

829
01:27:53,478 --> 01:27:54,729
Oh,

830
01:27:54,854 --> 01:27:56,481
so it's a job well done.

831
01:27:56,606 --> 01:27:58,400
I'm not saying it's gone perfectly, but...

832
01:27:58,483 --> 01:28:01,111
You'll forgive me for not
putting up the bunting.

833
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:03,531
I find it rather difficult
to overlook monumental

834
01:28:03,613 --> 01:28:05,532
security breaches and dead operatives

835
01:28:05,657 --> 01:28:08,451
for which you are almost
single-handedly responsible.

836
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:13,832
He's using a polymorphic
engine to mutate the code.

837
01:28:13,957 --> 01:28:16,167
Whenever I try to gain access, it changes.

838
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:19,526
It's like solving a Rubik's
cube that's fighting back.

839
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,553
Stop.

840
01:28:28,263 --> 01:28:29,681
Go in on that.

841
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:37,397
Granborough.

842
01:28:38,064 --> 01:28:41,860
Granborough Road. It's an old
Tube station on the Metropolitan Line.

843
01:28:41,985 --> 01:28:43,611
Been closed for years.

844
01:28:45,655 --> 01:28:47,240
Use that as a key.

845
01:28:58,168 --> 01:29:00,253
Oh, look, it's a map!

846
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:03,590
It's London.

847
01:29:04,674 --> 01:29:06,968
Subterranean London.

848
01:29:08,553 --> 01:29:10,763
What's going on?
Why are the doors open?

849
01:29:21,274 --> 01:29:22,275
Oh, no.

850
01:29:22,317 --> 01:29:25,067
Can someone tell me how the
hell he got into our system?

851
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:30,200
Oh, shit.

852
01:29:30,325 --> 01:29:33,328
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

853
01:29:35,121 --> 01:29:36,289
He hacked us.

854
01:29:43,922 --> 01:29:45,340
Oh, no.

855
01:29:53,473 --> 01:29:54,682
Q.

856
01:29:55,308 --> 01:29:56,517
He's gone.

857
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:08,071
I'm in a stairwell below isolation.

858
01:30:08,404 --> 01:30:09,822
<i>Do you read me, Q?</i>

859
01:30:09,948 --> 01:30:11,698
I can hear you.
I'm looking for you.

860
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,010
Got you.
Tracking your location.

861
01:30:24,504 --> 01:30:25,964
<i>Just keep moving forward.</i>

862
01:30:26,422 --> 01:30:28,549
<i>Enter the next service door on your right.</i>

863
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:38,090
<i>If you're through that door,
you should be in the Tube.</i>

864
01:30:38,184 --> 01:30:39,644
I'm in the Tube.

865
01:30:41,271 --> 01:30:44,315
Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.

866
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,027
<i>He wanted us to capture him, he
wanted us to access his computer.</i>

867
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:48,736
<i>It was all planned.</i>

868
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:52,365
Blowing up HQ.
Knowing the emergency protocols.

869
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:54,200
Knowing we'd retreat down here.

870
01:30:54,617 --> 01:30:58,705
I've got all that. It's what he's
got planned next that worries me.

871
01:30:59,205 --> 01:31:02,455
District Line is the closest.
There's a service door on your left.

872
01:31:03,793 --> 01:31:04,961
Got it.

873
01:31:08,715 --> 01:31:09,882
It won't open.

874
01:31:10,049 --> 01:31:11,301
It will.
Put your back into it.

875
01:31:11,384 --> 01:31:14,084
Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?

876
01:31:17,557 --> 01:31:19,183
No, it's stuck.

877
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:22,562
Oh, good.
There's a train coming.

878
01:31:27,567 --> 01:31:29,402
Hmm. That's vexing.

879
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:43,708
I'm through.

880
01:31:44,542 --> 01:31:46,044
Told you.

881
01:31:46,169 --> 01:31:48,369
We alerted security.
Police are on their way.

882
01:32:25,666 --> 01:32:26,959
Where are you now?

883
01:32:27,085 --> 01:32:28,336
Temple Tube station.

884
01:32:28,628 --> 01:32:30,129
Along with half of London.

885
01:32:34,926 --> 01:32:36,376
Oh, I see you. There you are.

886
01:32:36,844 --> 01:32:40,515
I know where I am, Q.
Where's he?

887
01:32:40,807 --> 01:32:42,642
<i>Give us a second.
I'm looking for him.</i>

888
01:32:42,725 --> 01:32:44,185
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

889
01:32:51,109 --> 01:32:53,109
<i>There's too many people.
I can't see him.</i>

890
01:32:53,236 --> 01:32:55,238
Welcome to rush hour on the Tube.

891
01:32:55,863 --> 01:32:57,663
Not something you'd know much about.

892
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,076
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

893
01:33:08,376 --> 01:33:11,129
The train's leaving.
Do I get on the train?

894
01:33:11,712 --> 01:33:14,462
Don't get on. I'm not sure
he's on it. Give us a minute.

895
01:33:17,176 --> 01:33:18,276
<i>Do I get on the train?</i>

896
01:33:24,183 --> 01:33:25,184
Bond.

897
01:33:25,309 --> 01:33:27,145
<i>- What?</i>
- Get on the train.

898
01:33:41,534 --> 01:33:42,910
He's keen to get home.

899
01:33:43,786 --> 01:33:45,336
Will you open the door, please?

900
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,750
Open the door.

901
01:33:52,837 --> 01:33:54,922
Health and Safety.
Carry on.

902
01:34:01,721 --> 01:34:02,763
<i>Where are you?</i>

903
01:34:02,972 --> 01:34:04,932
Take a wild guess, Q.

904
01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:07,727
<i>He's in disguise, dressed as a policeman.</i>

905
01:34:07,894 --> 01:34:09,353
Of course he is.

906
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:33,169
Where's he going?
Where's he going?

907
01:34:40,593 --> 01:34:43,387
He's going for M. Tell
Tanner. Get her out of there.

908
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:47,266
You've overlooked, or
chosen to ignore, hard evidence

909
01:34:48,142 --> 01:34:51,020
and consistently, almost obstinately...

910
01:34:51,354 --> 01:34:53,689
Silva's escaped.
Bond's in pursuit.

911
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:56,531
We need to get you to a
secure location immediately.

912
01:34:56,651 --> 01:34:58,851
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna show her my back.

913
01:34:59,237 --> 01:35:00,837
Are we straining your attention?

914
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:04,659
No. Please, Minister, proceed.

915
01:35:12,959 --> 01:35:14,168
Excuse me.

916
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:33,813
Move! Move!

917
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,378
It's as if you insist on pretending

918
01:36:39,503 --> 01:36:41,603
we still live in a golden age of espionage

919
01:36:41,881 --> 01:36:44,681
where human intelligence was
the only resource available.

920
01:36:45,009 --> 01:36:47,303
Well, I find this
rather old-fashioned belief

921
01:36:47,428 --> 01:36:49,722
demonstrates a reckless disregard for...

922
01:36:49,889 --> 01:36:52,141
Excuse me, Minister,
I don't mean to interrupt,

923
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,352
but just for the sake of variety,

924
01:36:54,727 --> 01:36:56,812
might we actually hear from the witness?

925
01:36:58,814 --> 01:37:00,066
Of course.

926
01:37:03,402 --> 01:37:04,528
Thank you.

927
01:37:29,887 --> 01:37:30,888
Oh!

928
01:37:33,182 --> 01:37:34,934
I won't miss next time,
Mr. Silva.

929
01:37:35,393 --> 01:37:38,771
Not bad. Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.

930
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:41,315
Oi. Thank you.

931
01:37:41,607 --> 01:37:42,775
You caught me.

932
01:37:44,694 --> 01:37:47,613
Now, here's your prize.

933
01:37:47,863 --> 01:37:51,283
The latest thing from my local toy store.

934
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:53,953
It's called radio.

935
01:37:58,916 --> 01:37:59,917
Whew!

936
01:38:02,461 --> 01:38:04,213
I do hope that wasn't for me.

937
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:05,965
No.

938
01:38:06,632 --> 01:38:07,925
But that is.

939
01:38:59,351 --> 01:39:00,686
<i>Chairman, Ministers.</i>

940
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:03,314
<i>Today I've repeatedly heard how</i>

941
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:05,691
<i>irrelevant my department has become.</i>

942
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:07,944
Why do we need agents?
The Double-O section?

943
01:39:08,027 --> 01:39:10,029
Isn't it all rather quaint?

944
01:39:11,864 --> 01:39:14,658
Well, I suppose I see a
different world than you do.

945
01:39:16,202 --> 01:39:19,371
And the truth is that
what I see frightens me.

946
01:39:21,332 --> 01:39:25,169
I'm frightened because our
enemies are no longer known to us.

947
01:39:25,795 --> 01:39:27,588
They do not exist on a map.

948
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:30,174
They're not nations.
They are individuals.

949
01:39:33,427 --> 01:39:35,027
Look around you.
Who do you fear?

950
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:38,891
<i>Can you see a face?
A uniform? A flag? No.</i>

951
01:39:40,226 --> 01:39:42,394
<i>Our world is not more transparent now.</i>

952
01:39:42,561 --> 01:39:44,188
It's more opaque.

953
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,898
It's in the shadows.

954
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:49,401
That's where we must do battle.

955
01:39:50,528 --> 01:39:53,489
So, before you declare us
irrelevant, ask yourselves,

956
01:39:54,907 --> 01:39:57,368
how safe do you feel?

957
01:40:01,747 --> 01:40:03,666
I've just one more thing to say.

958
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:06,752
My late husband was a
great lover of poetry.

959
01:40:07,002 --> 01:40:08,337
And, um...

960
01:40:09,004 --> 01:40:12,758
I suppose some of it sunk in,
despite my best intentions.

961
01:40:13,592 --> 01:40:17,930
<i>And here today I remember this,
I think from Tennyson:</i>

962
01:40:20,391 --> 01:40:23,602
<i>"We are not now that strength,"</i>

963
01:40:23,853 --> 01:40:26,605
<i>"which in old days
moved earth and heaven;"</i>

964
01:40:28,023 --> 01:40:30,276
"That which we are, we are;"

965
01:40:31,068 --> 01:40:34,113
<i>"One equal temper of heroic hearts,"</i>

966
01:40:34,738 --> 01:40:37,449
"Made weak by time"

967
01:40:37,867 --> 01:40:39,285
"and fate,"

968
01:40:40,119 --> 01:40:42,121
<i>"but strong in will."</i>

969
01:40:42,621 --> 01:40:44,415
"To strive, to seek,"

970
01:40:45,249 --> 01:40:46,750
<i>"to find"</i>

971
01:40:47,042 --> 01:40:49,086
"and not to yield."

972
01:42:11,126 --> 01:42:12,461
Go, go, go, go!

973
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:13,545
Move!

974
01:42:14,004 --> 01:42:15,547
Move! Go! Move!

975
01:42:56,005 --> 01:42:59,091
007, what the hell are we doing?
Are you kidnapping me?

976
01:42:59,258 --> 01:43:01,208
That would be one way of looking at it.

977
01:43:04,013 --> 01:43:06,181
Too many people are dying because of me.

978
01:43:06,432 --> 01:43:08,672
If he wants you, he's going
to have to come and get you.

979
01:43:08,726 --> 01:43:11,145
We've been one step behind
Silva from the start.

980
01:43:11,228 --> 01:43:13,528
It's time to get out in front,
change the game.

981
01:43:14,356 --> 01:43:15,566
And I'm to be the bait?

982
01:43:18,527 --> 01:43:21,739
All right. But just us.
No one else.

983
01:43:23,282 --> 01:43:25,617
Q? I need help.

984
01:43:25,868 --> 01:43:27,828
I'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?

985
01:43:27,911 --> 01:43:29,830
I've got M.
We're about to disappear.

986
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:31,415
What?

987
01:43:31,623 --> 01:43:33,873
I need you to lay a trail of
breadcrumbs impossible to follow

988
01:43:33,876 --> 01:43:36,128
for anyone except Silva.
Think you can do it?

989
01:43:38,088 --> 01:43:40,090
I'm guessing this isn't strictly official.

990
01:43:40,132 --> 01:43:41,300
Not even remotely.

991
01:43:41,592 --> 01:43:44,511
So much for my promising
career in espionage.

992
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:55,731
I'm not hiding in there,
if that's your brilliant plan.

993
01:43:55,814 --> 01:43:57,524
We're changing vehicles.

994
01:43:58,358 --> 01:44:01,779
Trouble with company cars is
they have trackers.

995
01:44:11,413 --> 01:44:14,416
Oh, and I suppose that's
completely inconspicuous.

996
01:44:15,167 --> 01:44:16,293
Get in.

997
01:44:39,149 --> 01:44:41,026
It's not very comfortable, is it?

998
01:44:43,028 --> 01:44:45,030
Are you gonna complain the whole way?

999
01:44:45,155 --> 01:44:47,199
Oh, go on then, eject me.
See if I care.

1000
01:44:50,452 --> 01:44:51,552
Where are we going?

1001
01:44:53,413 --> 01:44:54,706
Back in time.

1002
01:44:55,791 --> 01:44:58,127
Somewhere we'll have the advantage.

1003
01:44:59,878 --> 01:45:01,338
It's a fine line.

1004
01:45:01,463 --> 01:45:03,966
Make the breadcrumb too small
and he might miss it.

1005
01:45:04,216 --> 01:45:06,301
Too big and Silva will smell a rat.

1006
01:45:06,718 --> 01:45:09,368
But do you think even Silva
will be able to spot that?

1007
01:45:09,805 --> 01:45:11,682
He's the only one who could.

1008
01:45:14,059 --> 01:45:15,185
Sir.

1009
01:45:16,728 --> 01:45:17,729
Oh.

1010
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:19,481
What are you doing?

1011
01:45:19,606 --> 01:45:20,899
We're just... monitoring.

1012
01:45:21,024 --> 01:45:23,652
Creating a false tracking
signal for Silva to follow.

1013
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:26,488
- Well, sir, um...
- Well, no.

1014
01:45:26,697 --> 01:45:28,574
Excellent thinking.
Get him isolated.

1015
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:30,659
Send him on the A9.
It's the direct route.

1016
01:45:30,742 --> 01:45:32,911
You can monitor his progress
more accurately

1017
01:45:33,036 --> 01:45:34,997
and confirm it with the traffic cameras.

1018
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,124
But what if the PM finds out?

1019
01:45:38,417 --> 01:45:40,043
Then we're all buggered.

1020
01:45:40,752 --> 01:45:42,087
Carry on.

1021
01:46:24,379 --> 01:46:26,215
Is this where you grew up?

1022
01:46:26,882 --> 01:46:27,883
Mm.

1023
01:46:30,469 --> 01:46:32,346
How old were you when they died?

1024
01:46:36,058 --> 01:46:38,143
You know the answer to that.

1025
01:46:40,479 --> 01:46:42,606
You know the whole story.

1026
01:46:50,447 --> 01:46:53,075
Orphans always make the best recruits.

1027
01:46:59,248 --> 01:47:00,832
Storm's coming.

1028
01:48:00,851 --> 01:48:02,060
Christ.

1029
01:48:02,102 --> 01:48:03,103
Mm-hmm.

1030
01:48:04,646 --> 01:48:06,690
No wonder you never came back.

1031
01:49:00,452 --> 01:49:01,870
James.

1032
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:03,872
James Bond.

1033
01:49:04,122 --> 01:49:05,123
Good God.

1034
01:49:06,875 --> 01:49:08,251
Are you still alive?

1035
01:49:09,961 --> 01:49:11,713
It's nice to see you, too.

1036
01:49:14,091 --> 01:49:16,468
M, this is Kincade.

1037
01:49:16,968 --> 01:49:18,804
Gamekeeper here since I was a boy.

1038
01:49:19,304 --> 01:49:20,431
Pleased to meet you, Emma.

1039
01:49:20,514 --> 01:49:21,640
Mr. Kincade.

1040
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,394
You're a tad late.
They've sold the place,

1041
01:49:25,477 --> 01:49:26,770
when they thought you were dead.

1042
01:49:26,812 --> 01:49:28,480
It seems they were wrong.

1043
01:49:29,773 --> 01:49:31,108
What are you doing here?

1044
01:49:31,483 --> 01:49:33,151
Some men are coming to kill us.

1045
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:36,420
But we're gonna kill them first.

1046
01:49:37,989 --> 01:49:39,408
Then we'd better get ready.

1047
01:49:41,785 --> 01:49:43,412
Do we still have a gun room?

1048
01:49:44,162 --> 01:49:45,163
Ah.

1049
01:49:47,124 --> 01:49:51,503
They sold the lot to a collector
from Idaho or some such place.

1050
01:49:51,962 --> 01:49:54,089
They were shipped out weeks ago.

1051
01:49:54,631 --> 01:49:56,007
There's just...

1052
01:49:56,675 --> 01:50:00,178
your father's old hunting rifle.

1053
01:50:01,304 --> 01:50:03,140
We couldn't let that go.

1054
01:50:09,104 --> 01:50:10,522
And this is what we've got.

1055
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:15,240
There might be a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.

1056
01:50:15,527 --> 01:50:17,863
But if all else fails,

1057
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:22,534
sometimes the old ways are the best.

1058
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:31,042
So who is it we're
supposed to be fighting?

1059
01:50:31,376 --> 01:50:33,712
No "we" in it, Kincade.

1060
01:50:34,212 --> 01:50:35,797
This is not your fight.

1061
01:50:35,881 --> 01:50:39,050
Try and stop me,
you jumped-up little shit.

1062
01:50:40,677 --> 01:50:44,097
Now, remember what I taught
you. Don't let it pull to the left.

1063
01:50:45,557 --> 01:50:47,392
I'll do my best.

1064
01:50:56,151 --> 01:50:58,111
What did you say you did for a living?

1065
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:15,128
Emma!

1066
01:51:15,921 --> 01:51:17,547
I brought you some things.

1067
01:51:20,759 --> 01:51:22,928
The nights get cold here.

1068
01:51:23,386 --> 01:51:25,347
Thank you, Mr. Kincade.

1069
01:51:26,765 --> 01:51:27,850
It's a beautiful old house.

1070
01:51:27,933 --> 01:51:28,975
She is.

1071
01:51:29,935 --> 01:51:34,856
And like all great ladies,
she still has her secret ways.

1072
01:51:35,357 --> 01:51:36,483
Let me show you this.

1073
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:42,948
Priest's hole?

1074
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:45,617
Yeah, from Reformation times.

1075
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:48,286
The tunnel leads under the moor.

1076
01:51:48,411 --> 01:51:50,761
If you get in danger,
this is the place to come.

1077
01:51:51,248 --> 01:51:56,545
The night I told him his parents had
died, he hid in here for two days.

1078
01:51:58,964 --> 01:52:00,131
When he did come out...

1079
01:52:00,799 --> 01:52:02,467
he wasn't a boy anymore.

1080
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:06,263
Eh. Must get on.

1081
01:54:06,675 --> 01:54:08,593
I fucked this up, didn't I?

1082
01:54:10,303 --> 01:54:11,471
No.

1083
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:15,100
You did your job.

1084
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:21,898
I read your obituary of me.

1085
01:54:23,650 --> 01:54:24,776
And?

1086
01:54:24,943 --> 01:54:26,069
Appalling.

1087
01:54:26,903 --> 01:54:28,405
Yeah, I knew you'd hate it.

1088
01:54:30,532 --> 01:54:33,034
I did call you "an exemplar
of British fortitude".

1089
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:35,578
That bit was all right.

1090
01:54:40,792 --> 01:54:41,918
You ready?

1091
01:54:42,502 --> 01:54:45,588
I was ready before you were born, son.

1092
01:56:04,876 --> 01:56:06,377
Welcome to Scotland.

1093
01:57:23,246 --> 01:57:24,346
You dropped something.

1094
01:57:50,815 --> 01:57:51,858
You hurt?

1095
01:57:52,734 --> 01:57:55,069
Only my pride.
I never was a good shot.

1096
01:58:01,075 --> 01:58:02,160
He's not here.

1097
01:58:02,911 --> 01:58:04,037
He's not here.

1098
01:58:38,571 --> 01:58:40,406
Always got to make an entrance.

1099
01:58:41,991 --> 01:58:44,035
You two, go to the kitchen.
Now.

1100
01:59:08,226 --> 01:59:09,227
Get behind the arch!

1101
01:59:52,687 --> 01:59:54,287
Go to the chapel.
Use the tunnel.

1102
02:01:16,145 --> 02:01:20,358
Everyone, listen to me! Don't
you dare touch her. She's mine.

1103
02:01:37,375 --> 02:01:39,325
Can your friend come out and say hello?

1104
02:02:46,694 --> 02:02:48,779
Come on. This way.

1105
02:03:46,629 --> 02:03:48,673
I always hated this place.

1106
02:03:59,058 --> 02:04:00,518
Are you getting warm?

1107
02:05:29,482 --> 02:05:31,650
Just make sure Bond's dead!

1108
02:05:35,029 --> 02:05:37,239
Now it's me and her.

1109
02:07:35,357 --> 02:07:38,819
You see what comes of all
this running around, Mr. Bond?

1110
02:07:39,987 --> 02:07:42,239
All this jumping and fighting.

1111
02:07:42,406 --> 02:07:44,283
It's exhausting!

1112
02:07:47,453 --> 02:07:48,913
Relax.

1113
02:07:50,581 --> 02:07:52,333
You need to relax.

1114
02:08:11,143 --> 02:08:13,938
Ah, well...
Mother's calling.

1115
02:08:15,564 --> 02:08:17,691
I'll give her a goodbye kiss for you.

1116
02:08:37,086 --> 02:08:39,129
Oh, my God.

1117
02:10:36,789 --> 02:10:38,666
Of course.

1118
02:10:39,083 --> 02:10:40,709
It had to be here.

1119
02:10:43,087 --> 02:10:44,713
It had to be this way.

1120
02:10:46,173 --> 02:10:47,633
Thank you.

1121
02:10:47,758 --> 02:10:49,468
- I can't find it no...
- Don't.

1122
02:10:53,430 --> 02:10:56,016
Please. Don't.

1123
02:11:11,323 --> 02:11:13,742
You're hurt. You're hurt.

1124
02:11:17,996 --> 02:11:19,915
What have they done to you?

1125
02:11:20,457 --> 02:11:22,584
What have they done to you?

1126
02:11:55,075 --> 02:11:56,618
Free both of us.

1127
02:11:57,077 --> 02:11:58,787
Free both of us...

1128
02:12:00,122 --> 02:12:01,373
with the same bullet.

1129
02:12:03,125 --> 02:12:04,293
Do it.

1130
02:12:04,877 --> 02:12:06,003
Do it.

1131
02:12:08,130 --> 02:12:09,339
Only you can do it.

1132
02:12:10,132 --> 02:12:11,383
Do it.

1133
02:12:27,191 --> 02:12:28,442
Ah!

1134
02:12:54,384 --> 02:12:56,178
Last rat standing.

1135
02:13:06,438 --> 02:13:09,441
007. What took you so long?

1136
02:13:09,733 --> 02:13:12,694
Well, I got into some deep water.

1137
02:13:14,613 --> 02:13:15,614
Oh!

1138
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:30,796
I suppose it's...

1139
02:13:31,213 --> 02:13:33,549
too late to make a run for it?

1140
02:13:39,721 --> 02:13:41,640
Well, I'm game if you are.

1141
02:13:52,067 --> 02:13:54,403
I did get one thing right.

1142
02:15:18,695 --> 02:15:19,947
Wow.

1143
02:15:21,198 --> 02:15:23,367
I didn't even know you could come up here.

1144
02:15:24,701 --> 02:15:26,536
Hate to waste a view.

1145
02:15:26,912 --> 02:15:28,622
I can see why.

1146
02:15:30,415 --> 02:15:33,293
I thought you were going
back out on active service.

1147
02:15:34,795 --> 02:15:36,588
I declined.

1148
02:15:38,256 --> 02:15:39,633
You said it yourself,

1149
02:15:40,217 --> 02:15:41,969
fieldwork's not for everyone.

1150
02:15:42,928 --> 02:15:45,806
If it helps, I feel a lot safer.

1151
02:15:51,103 --> 02:15:52,980
Her will was read today.

1152
02:15:53,897 --> 02:15:55,399
She left you this.

1153
02:16:07,661 --> 02:16:10,539
Maybe it was her way of
telling you to take a desk job.

1154
02:16:11,415 --> 02:16:13,166
Just the opposite.

1155
02:16:16,378 --> 02:16:17,671
Thank you.

1156
02:16:36,606 --> 02:16:39,151
You know, we've never formally
been introduced.

1157
02:16:42,821 --> 02:16:44,281
Well, my name's Eve.

1158
02:16:45,073 --> 02:16:46,491
Eve Moneypenny.

1159
02:16:47,451 --> 02:16:50,351
Well, I look forward to our time
together, Miss Moneypenny.

1160
02:16:50,537 --> 02:16:54,708
Me, too. I'm sure we'll have
one or two close shaves.

1161
02:16:57,085 --> 02:16:58,128
Morning, 007.

1162
02:16:58,253 --> 02:16:59,303
Good morning, Tanner.

1163
02:16:59,713 --> 02:17:00,714
He'll see you now.

1164
02:17:16,146 --> 02:17:17,481
How's the arm, sir?

1165
02:17:18,148 --> 02:17:20,609
What? Oh, it's fine.

1166
02:17:20,734 --> 02:17:21,985
It'll get better.

1167
02:17:22,110 --> 02:17:24,988
All pretty shocking for
someone unused to fieldwork.

1168
02:17:27,991 --> 02:17:31,495
So, 007...
Lots to be done.

1169
02:17:35,665 --> 02:17:37,584
Are you ready to get back to work?

1170
02:17:39,503 --> 02:17:41,588
With pleasure, M.

1171
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:45,842
With pleasure.

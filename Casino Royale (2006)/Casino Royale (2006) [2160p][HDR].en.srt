1
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,550
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,140
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,869
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

4
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,549
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:39,120
If M was so sure that I was bent...

6
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,259
...she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,670
Benefits of being section chief...

8
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,657
...I'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

9
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,030
...wouldn't I?

10
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,629
- Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
- Two.

11
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,590
Shame.

12
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,259
We barely got to know each other.

13
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,490
I know where you keep your gun.

14
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,530
I suppose that's something.

15
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,900
True.

16
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,139
How did he die?

17
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,810
Your contact?

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
Not well.

19
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,460
Made you feel it, did he?

20
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,699
Well...

21
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,129
...you needn't worry.

22
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,259
The second is...

23
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,079
Yes.

24
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,939
Considerably.

25
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,149
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

26
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,920
You asked for the introduction.

27
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,350
That's all my organization will guarantee.

28
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,430
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

29
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:28,017
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

30
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,800
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

31
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,879
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

32
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,710
No.

33
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,580
I believe in a reasonable rate of return.

34
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,049
I want no risk in the portfolio.

35
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,519
Agreed.

36
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,737
And I can access it anywhere in the world?

37
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,919
Yes.

38
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,110
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

39
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,970
...of Skyfleet stock.

40
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:17,049
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

41
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,419
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

42
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,320
Just do it.

43
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,559
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

44
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,929
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

45
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,019
He's on the move.

46
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,149
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

47
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,009
Stop touching your ear.

48
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,279
- Sorry?
- Put your hand down.

49
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,319
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

50
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,526
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

51
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:15,009
...my dear general.

52
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,240
Nothing sinister.

53
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,880
All in.

54
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:29,809
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

55
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,119
...of making your straight.

56
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,890
When does Ellipsis expire?

57
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:04,250
- We have less than 36 hours. I can...
- No. No, no.

58
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,190
That's all the time I have anyway.

59
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,130
Give our guests five minutes to leave...

60
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,630
...or throw them overboard.

61
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,980
Who the hell do they think they are?

62
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,766
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

63
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:31,167
...not to ask me what we do.

64
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,950
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

65
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,176
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

66
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,819
And how the hell could Bond be so stupid?

67
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:44,016
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

68
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,500
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

69
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,357
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

70
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,186
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

71
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,099
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

72
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,380
You've got a bloody cheek.

73
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:13,079
Sorry.

74
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:15,189
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

75
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:16,950
Or yourself.

76
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,180
You stormed into an embassy.

77
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,920
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

78
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,830
...of international relationships.

79
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,869
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

80
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:28,069
We wanted to question him, not kill him.

81
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:32,286
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

82
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,430
I did.

83
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:36,766
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

84
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,640
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

85
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,797
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

86
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,506
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

87
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,710
Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?

88
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,150
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

89
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,190
And thanks to your trigger finger...

90
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,259
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

91
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,810
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

92
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,716
The same way I found out your name.

93
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,857
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for...

94
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,410
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

95
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,599
I knew it was too early to promote you.

96
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,079
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy...

97
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,480
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

98
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,630
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

99
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:31,200
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

100
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:34,529
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

101
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,599
Any thug can kill.

102
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,259
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

103
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,930
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

104
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:45,910
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

105
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,740
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

106
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,107
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

107
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,676
...and think about your future.

108
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,660
Because these bastards want your head.

109
00:24:57,859 --> 00:25:01,319
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

110
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,660
And Bond...

111
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,670
...don't ever break into
my house again.

112
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,549
Ma'am.

113
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,089
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

114
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,329
Hey. Hey.

115
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:56,140
Hello.

116
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:58,470
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

117
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:01,980
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

118
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,329
Security to car park.
Security to car park.

119
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:50,230
Absolutely incredible.

120
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:31,819
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

121
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:35,587
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

122
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,069
Okay.

123
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:41,940
- We have an ocean-view villa.
- Perfect.

124
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,380
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...

125
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,470
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

126
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,907
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know...?

127
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,420
- Mr. Dimitrios.
- Right.

128
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,476
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

129
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,409
Isn't the type to take bad news well.

130
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,099
But if I felt compelled to find him?

131
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,359
He has a house just up the beach.

132
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,299
Thank you.

133
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,099
- What?
- He's in the Bahamas.

134
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,740
You woke me to share his holiday plans?

135
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,026
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

136
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:22,170
...using your name and password.

137
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,240
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

138
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,809
Well, I'm doing my best to find out.

139
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,880
- Who's he looking at?
- Alex Dimitrios.

140
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:33,910
That slimy bugger.

141
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,400
Now known associates...

142
00:31:58,109 --> 00:31:59,549
Le Chiffre.

143
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,630
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

144
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:21,299
How can I assist you, sir?

145
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,850
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

146
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,686
- Look what just happened.
- Good job, big boy.

147
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah.

148
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,966
Do you mind if I join?

149
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:39,399
- Oh, good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.

150
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,869
Small blind, big blind.

151
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:54,730
I'm in.

152
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,829
Bet's to you.

153
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:04,269
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

154
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,109
Two hundred to you.

155
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,250
Bet's to you.

156
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,950
I heard you.

157
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:18,349
Five to call.

158
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,377
- Action's to you.
- Pair of sevens.

159
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,829
Ace high.

160
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,970
Check or bet.

161
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,660
- Check.
- And to you.

162
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,809
Five thousand.

163
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,210
Five to call.

164
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,420
- Check.
- Check to you, sir.

165
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,420
All in.

166
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,890
No, wait.

167
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:58,769
Twenty thousand.

168
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:01,500
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

169
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:08,099
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

170
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,639
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

171
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,840
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

172
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:26,789
All right, show me, gentlemen.

173
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,230
Three kings.

174
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,170
There you go with my night.

175
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,769
Trip aces.

176
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,070
Aces win.

177
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,110
Oh, and the valet ticket.

178
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,889
Thank you.

179
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,559
Sir.

180
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:32,059
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

181
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,260
No wonder he was in such a foul mood.

182
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,690
My mistake.

183
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,250
Can I give you a lift home?

184
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,199
That would really send him over the edge.

185
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,340
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

186
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,739
Well, perhaps you're just out of practice.

187
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,710
Perhaps.

188
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,770
Well, what about a drink at my place?

189
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,550
Your place?

190
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:05,820
- Is it close?
- Very.

191
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,099
One drink.

192
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:41,147
Good evening, sir, and welcome back.

193
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,130
Welcome to my home.

194
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,440
I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.

195
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,309
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

196
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,010
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

197
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,289
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

198
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,059
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

199
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,230
But I do care about my reputation.

200
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:18,429
I have someone else willing to do the job.

201
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,429
He just needs the particulars...

202
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:23,030
...and payment.

203
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,639
You like married women, don't you, James?

204
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:40,050
It keeps things simple.

205
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:45,789
What is it about bad men?

206
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:48,960
You, my husband...

207
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,829
I had so many chances to be happy...

208
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,400
...so many nice guys.

209
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:57,300
Why can't nice guys be more like you?

210
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,739
Well, because then they'd be bad.

211
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,940
Yes.

212
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:08,510
But so much more interesting.

213
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:15,389
What makes your husband a bad man?

214
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,150
His nature, I suppose.

215
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,019
The nature of his work?

216
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,889
A mystery, I'm afraid.

217
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,869
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

218
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,539
How afraid?

219
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,909
Not enough to stop.

220
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,650
Can I ask you a personal question?

221
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,980
Now would seem an appropriate time.

222
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,559
Does "ellipsis" mean anything to you?

223
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,869
Should I ask him about it?

224
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,400
Perhaps later.

225
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,539
Yes, dear?

226
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:11,739
I'm on the last flight tonight to Miami.

227
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,469
Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.

228
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:17,010
Okay, I understand.

229
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:19,980
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

230
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,929
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

231
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,289
...so you have all night
to question me.

232
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,599
In that case...

233
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,929
...we're gonna need...

234
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,500
...some more champagne.

235
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:45,809
Good evening. Room Service.

236
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,809
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

237
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:51,269
...and the beluga caviar?

238
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:53,920
- With everything?
- Yes, with everything.

239
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,210
- And would that be for two, sir?
- What?

240
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,690
- For two?
- No, for one.

241
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:34,519
Wait here.

242
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:41,760
There you go. Number 53.

243
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:48,110
Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors...

244
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:51,139
...to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive...

245
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,110
...nervous and vascular systems.

246
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:57,110
Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

247
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,010
I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.

248
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,380
This is edutainment.

249
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:31,900
...fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses...

250
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,980
...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.

251
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,650
Hello.

252
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,769
Hello.

253
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,940
Do not leave your vehicle unattended.

254
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,710
Welcome to Miami International Airport.

255
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,039
Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted...

256
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,039
- Yes.
- It's Bond. I need her now.

257
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,000
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

258
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,576
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

259
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:59,409
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

260
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,360
- Sorry, can I put you on hold?
- I thought you might.

261
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,530
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

262
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:13,369
I'll call you back.

263
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:38,500
- The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
- What about it?

264
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:42,449
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

265
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,369
Oh, my God!

266
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:26,170
Bond? Bond!

267
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:31,280
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

268
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,420
It's launching today.

269
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,619
I gotta go.

270
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,690
Stop! Stop!

271
00:52:07,449 --> 00:52:09,449
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

272
00:53:42,449 --> 00:53:47,219
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

273
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:52,820
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

274
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,530
Someone talked.

275
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,377
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah, I have.

276
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,519
I'm gonna get a few more photos...

277
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:46,940
Quite the body count you're stacking up.

278
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,596
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

279
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:53,309
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

280
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:56,237
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

281
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,320
No.

282
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:00,949
- Not your name, what you were after?
- No.

283
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:02,717
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

284
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,677
Knew where to put his hands on weapons...

285
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,317
...and people who could use them.

286
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,147
He worked with anyone who had money.

287
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:11,599
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

288
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,826
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

289
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:17,369
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

290
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:19,340
Oh, good. You're here.

291
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,110
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

292
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,880
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

293
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,639
So you can keep an eye on me?

294
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,480
Yes.

295
00:56:05,389 --> 00:56:08,519
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9.11...

296
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:12,030
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

297
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,059
When the stocks hit bottom on 9I12,
somebody made a fortune.

298
00:56:16,769 --> 00:56:19,456
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

299
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:20,769
...or was supposed to.

300
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:24,739
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

301
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:28,969
Instead, somebody lost over
$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

302
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,880
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

303
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,136
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

304
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:36,920
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

305
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,179
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

306
00:56:41,389 --> 00:56:44,159
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

307
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,920
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

308
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:49,217
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

309
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,570
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

310
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:57,170
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

311
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,326
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

312
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:01,897
We can't let him win this game.

313
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,210
If he loses, he'll have nowhere to run.

314
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,320
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

315
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:09,179
I'm putting you in the game...

316
00:57:09,389 --> 00:57:12,050
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

317
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,820
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

318
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:18,059
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

319
00:57:22,699 --> 00:57:27,039
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

320
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:30,400
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

321
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,940
No.

322
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:36,760
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

323
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,179
We'll know where you are.

324
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,750
You can stop pretending.

325
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:43,869
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

326
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,119
Well, I knew you were you.

327
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:07,369
Thank you.

328
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:15,750
I'm the money.

329
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,320
Every penny of it.

330
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,160
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

331
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,889
"Vesper."

332
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:29,649
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

333
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:31,800
Thank you.

334
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,670
Your boss must be well-connected.

335
00:58:33,869 --> 00:58:36,369
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

336
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:38,539
Or quite so stylishly.

337
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,079
May I ask you where it is?

338
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,930
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

339
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:49,349
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

340
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,706
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

341
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:55,690
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

342
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,460
What looks good?

343
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,610
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

344
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,797
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

345
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,830
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

346
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,179
So that would be what you call "bluffing"?

347
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,849
You've heard the term.

348
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,677
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

349
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,246
You play the man across from you.

350
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:29,729
- And you're good at reading people?
- Yes, I am.

351
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,717
Which is why I've been able to detect...

352
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,950
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

353
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:37,500
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

354
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,886
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

355
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:42,460
So there is a plan?

356
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,366
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

357
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:47,679
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

358
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,909
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

359
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,280
About you, Miss Lynd?

360
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:54,079
Well, your beauty's a problem.

361
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,550
You worry you won't be taken seriously.

362
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,750
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

363
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,647
True, but this one overcompensates...

364
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,677
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

365
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,246
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

366
01:00:06,329 --> 01:00:08,800
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor...

367
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,456
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

368
01:00:12,539 --> 01:00:14,730
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

369
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,710
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

370
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:22,239
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

371
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:25,667
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

372
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,409
...I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

373
01:00:31,389 --> 01:00:33,320
All right.

374
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:36,877
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

375
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,447
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

376
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,429
But you wear it with such disdain...

377
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,656
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

378
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:46,300
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

379
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,556
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

380
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:51,627
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

381
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,326
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

382
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:56,400
...that's what I'd say you are.

383
01:01:00,349 --> 01:01:02,340
Oh, you are.

384
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,650
I like this poker thing.

385
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,619
And that makes perfect sense...

386
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,230
...since MI6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

387
01:01:09,429 --> 01:01:11,817
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

388
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,090
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

389
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,389
You know...

390
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,539
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

391
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:22,409
- Rolex?
- Omega.

392
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:24,440
Beautiful.

393
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,610
Now, having just met you...

394
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:29,766
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

395
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:31,210
No, of course not.

396
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,237
But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine.

397
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,520
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

398
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:37,780
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

399
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,389
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

400
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:44,147
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

401
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:46,199
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

402
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,190
You noticed?

403
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,389
Even accountants have imagination.

404
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:51,929
How was your lamb?

405
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,900
Skewered.

406
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,730
One sympathizes.

407
01:01:57,579 --> 01:01:59,070
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

408
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,610
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

409
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:20,099
- Hotel Splendid, sir?
- That's right.

410
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:24,599
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

411
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:40,920
It's just last-minute details.

412
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:44,369
Apparently we're very much in love.

413
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:48,177
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

414
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,960
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

415
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,329
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

416
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,217
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest...

417
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,616
- I am not.
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.

418
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:00,670
Oh, no, I don't.

419
01:03:00,869 --> 01:03:02,869
We've been involved for quite a while...

420
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:05,130
...hence the shared suite.

421
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,710
But my family is strict Roman Catholic...

422
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,757
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

423
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,110
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

424
01:03:14,409 --> 01:03:16,809
Religion and a securely locked door.

425
01:03:17,019 --> 01:03:19,107
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

426
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,949
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

427
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:23,280
Smart?

428
01:03:23,889 --> 01:03:25,590
Single.

429
01:03:44,809 --> 01:03:46,927
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

430
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:49,880
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

431
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,809
- Welcome, Mr. Bond.
- You sign that, dear.

432
01:03:53,449 --> 01:03:55,789
You represent the Treasury.

433
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:02,789
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

434
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,590
I will. Thank you.

435
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:08,760
Very funny.

436
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:11,056
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

437
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,326
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

438
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:15,639
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

439
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,326
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

440
01:04:18,409 --> 01:04:20,826
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

441
01:04:20,909 --> 01:04:23,440
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

442
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,507
And now he knows something about you.

443
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:27,780
He knows you're reckless.

444
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:30,219
Take the next one.

445
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,289
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

446
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:35,250
Mr. Bond?

447
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,789
- It was left for you.
- Thank you.

448
01:05:08,929 --> 01:05:10,449
I love you too, M.

449
01:05:49,639 --> 01:05:54,840
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

450
01:05:58,349 --> 01:06:00,027
Does he know we've been watching him?

451
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:02,780
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

452
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:07,320
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

453
01:06:07,949 --> 01:06:10,036
I'm afraid if you get into trouble here...

454
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:13,849
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

455
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,190
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

456
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:21,159
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

457
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:24,699
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

458
01:06:24,909 --> 01:06:26,809
That's him, with the mustache.

459
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:28,570
Over my left shoulder.

460
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:31,840
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

461
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:34,010
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

462
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,840
He's not a very subtle man.

463
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:40,210
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

464
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,619
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

465
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:52,889
I hate to say it...

466
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:57,059
...but the accountants seem
to be running MI6 these days.

467
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:01,340
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

468
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:03,809
Many of them are lovely people.

469
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:08,440
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

470
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:12,239
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

471
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:16,789
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

472
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:22,349
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

473
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:29,199
Yes?

474
01:07:29,869 --> 01:07:31,530
For you.

475
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:35,199
Something you expect me to wear?

476
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:39,079
I need you looking fabulous.

477
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:41,636
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

478
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:44,197
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

479
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,010
...and not about their cards.

480
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:48,619
Do you think you can do that for me?

481
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:50,760
I'll do my best.

482
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:53,760
Thank you.

483
01:08:05,769 --> 01:08:07,000
I have a dinner jacket.

484
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:10,539
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

485
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:11,900
This is the latter.

486
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:15,309
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

487
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,380
How...?

488
01:08:18,189 --> 01:08:19,649
It's tailored.

489
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:22,409
I sized you up the moment we met.

490
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:18,739
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

491
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,340
Thank you.

492
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,250
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

493
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,560
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

494
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:41,560
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

495
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:44,199
Well, we wouldn't want that, would we?

496
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:55,640
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

497
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,439
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

498
01:09:58,649 --> 01:10:00,590
Five communal cards, two in the hole.

499
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:03,937
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

500
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,250
...holding the stakes.

501
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,090
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

502
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:13,316
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

503
01:10:13,399 --> 01:10:15,616
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

504
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:18,557
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

505
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,840
...into the encryptor...

506
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:21,856
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

507
01:10:21,939 --> 01:10:24,339
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

508
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,369
Mr. Bond?

509
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,097
We proceed alphabetically.

510
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,930
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

511
01:10:39,029 --> 01:10:40,189
Six letters or more.

512
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:55,939
High card for dealer position.

513
01:11:02,979 --> 01:11:04,279
It's Signor Gallardo.

514
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:07,510
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

515
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:11,180
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

516
01:11:13,289 --> 01:11:15,319
Well, enjoy the game.

517
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:40,279
Four players.

518
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:44,220
It's your bet.

519
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,229
Check.

520
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,220
Check.

521
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:55,590
Bet. Fifty thousand.

522
01:12:08,819 --> 01:12:10,079
Call.

523
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:14,619
Fold.

524
01:12:16,819 --> 01:12:19,220
Fold. Heads up.

525
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:24,960
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

526
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:39,039
Bet. One hundred thousand.

527
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:45,140
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

528
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,380
Was I? Forgive me.

529
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,119
Good luck, darling.

530
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:57,329
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

531
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,489
Monsieur Bond?

532
01:13:00,699 --> 01:13:03,359
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

533
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:05,899
Call.

534
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:12,199
Hello.

535
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:16,010
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

536
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:19,340
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

537
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:20,550
Champagne.

538
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,090
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

539
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,470
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

540
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,640
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

541
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:53,479
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

542
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:55,479
Mr. Bond?

543
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:59,720
Fold.

544
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,430
Send the barman over, please.

545
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:20,380
A dry martini. Wait.

546
01:14:20,579 --> 01:14:22,396
Three measures Gordon's, one of vodka...

547
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:24,437
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

548
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,350
- ...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
- Yes, sir.

549
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:30,420
- You know, I'll have one of those.
- So will I.

550
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:32,619
Certainly.

551
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:37,460
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

552
01:14:38,329 --> 01:14:39,659
That's it?

553
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,560
Anyone want to play poker now?

554
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:43,930
Someone's in a hurry.

555
01:14:52,949 --> 01:14:54,880
Would you excuse me?

556
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:09,729
You taste nice.

557
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:12,859
- I thought we dispensed with covers.
- No.

558
01:15:13,069 --> 01:15:16,760
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

559
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,489
- Is he watching?
- Yes.

560
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:19,760
Good.

561
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:22,856
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

562
01:15:22,939 --> 01:15:24,710
...we won't be here past midnight.

563
01:15:24,909 --> 01:15:27,880
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

564
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:30,069
Check.

565
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,667
- You know, that's not half bad.
- Up to you.

566
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,850
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

567
01:15:36,189 --> 01:15:38,750
It was worth it to discover his tell.

568
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:40,350
What do you mean?

569
01:15:40,729 --> 01:15:42,779
The twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.

570
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,090
- Bluffs? He had the best hand.
- Which he got on the last card.

571
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,616
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

572
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:51,786
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

573
01:15:51,869 --> 01:15:53,399
Winning was blind luck.

574
01:15:53,609 --> 01:15:55,439
- Did you get the bug?
- Yes.

575
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,510
Bet. One hundred thousand.

576
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:59,229
Thank you.

577
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:02,597
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

578
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,710
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

579
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:07,989
Call.

580
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,560
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

581
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:16,619
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

582
01:16:16,829 --> 01:16:18,717
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

583
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:23,260
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

584
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:57,869
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

585
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:01,340
So?

586
01:17:01,539 --> 01:17:03,670
You want to do what to me?

587
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,210
You've lost me completely.

588
01:17:05,409 --> 01:17:08,609
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

589
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:35,930
So, what's so damn important?

590
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:39,970
I'm sorry.

591
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,409
Where is my money?

592
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,276
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

593
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:52,590
You're holding a parcel for me.

594
01:17:57,229 --> 01:17:58,890
Thank you.

595
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:04,329
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

596
01:18:04,869 --> 01:18:06,670
Your money is safe.

597
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:10,199
Open that.

598
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:28,279
You'll have it tomorrow.

599
01:18:29,229 --> 01:18:30,529
All of it.

600
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:47,970
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

601
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,250
Hold out your arm.

602
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,319
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

603
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,550
...or I will take your head.

604
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:12,399
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

605
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,750
Stairs.

606
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:33,850
Not a word of protest.

607
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:37,020
You should find a new boyfriend.

608
01:21:39,189 --> 01:21:40,880
Go find Mathis.

609
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:44,437
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

610
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,550
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

611
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:52,979
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

612
01:22:53,329 --> 01:22:57,020
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

613
01:22:57,229 --> 01:22:58,460
A little.

614
01:22:58,659 --> 01:23:02,259
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

615
01:23:02,439 --> 01:23:06,460
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

616
01:24:07,699 --> 01:24:12,069
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

617
01:24:13,109 --> 01:24:14,970
Here, let's see.

618
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,390
That's better.

619
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:37,789
You cold?

620
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,399
Yeah.

621
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,500
Here.

622
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:40,489
You have any trouble with the bodies?

623
01:25:40,859 --> 01:25:42,989
Less than some.

624
01:25:56,779 --> 01:26:00,510
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

625
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:04,140
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

626
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:06,750
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

627
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:10,449
How's our girl?

628
01:26:10,989 --> 01:26:14,189
Melted your cold heart yet?

629
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:33,310
Call.

630
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:34,909
Fold.

631
01:26:35,109 --> 01:26:37,079
And call.

632
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,439
Three players.

633
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:45,819
Three hundred grand.

634
01:26:46,029 --> 01:26:47,689
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

635
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,220
Call.

636
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:53,970
And call.

637
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,399
Three players.

638
01:27:04,739 --> 01:27:05,739
Check.

639
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:12,409
Monsieur Bond?

640
01:27:22,289 --> 01:27:24,729
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

641
01:27:36,409 --> 01:27:40,710
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

642
01:27:40,909 --> 01:27:42,939
My God, James was right.

643
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,979
It's up to you.

644
01:27:52,119 --> 01:27:54,520
Raise. One million.

645
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,970
Seems someone knows something I don't.

646
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,199
Fold.

647
01:28:06,409 --> 01:28:08,170
Heads up, gentlemen.

648
01:28:08,369 --> 01:28:09,930
It's up to you.

649
01:28:24,119 --> 01:28:25,590
Two.

650
01:28:26,359 --> 01:28:28,449
Re-raise. Two million.

651
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,489
And it's up to you.

652
01:28:43,579 --> 01:28:45,439
I'm all in.

653
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:55,220
Well, it's 14 million and 500,000.

654
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:57,750
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

655
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:04,760
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

656
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:08,430
- Call.
- Call.

657
01:29:08,869 --> 01:29:11,229
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

658
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:15,369
Full house. Kings and aces.

659
01:29:15,569 --> 01:29:17,600
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

660
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,250
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

661
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:41,430
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

662
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:43,260
Please.

663
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:45,770
We will now break for one hour.

664
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:49,300
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

665
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:58,409
Good game.

666
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:29,880
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

667
01:30:30,449 --> 01:30:32,779
I can't do that, James.

668
01:30:33,319 --> 01:30:35,720
Look, I made a mistake.

669
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,510
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

670
01:30:39,729 --> 01:30:41,159
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

671
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:43,659
Sorry?

672
01:30:43,859 --> 01:30:45,630
Try putting that in a sentence.

673
01:30:45,829 --> 01:30:47,347
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

674
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:49,887
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

675
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:53,029
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

676
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:54,640
That's what this is about.

677
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,840
All you're going to do now is lose more.

678
01:30:57,439 --> 01:30:58,600
Then you're an idiot.

679
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:01,680
- I'm sorry?
- I said, you're a bloody idiot.

680
01:31:03,579 --> 01:31:05,850
Look in my eyes.

681
01:31:06,619 --> 01:31:08,380
I can beat this man, you know that.

682
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:13,619
Get your hand off my arm.

683
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,680
Vodka martini.

684
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,680
- Shaken or stirred?
- Do I look like I give a damn?

685
01:31:58,869 --> 01:32:01,140
- James.
- Get the girl out.

686
01:32:08,409 --> 01:32:09,409
Funny game, right?

687
01:32:09,579 --> 01:32:12,680
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

688
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:16,510
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

689
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,047
You should have a little faith.

690
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:22,746
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

691
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:25,090
Had. Excuse me.

692
01:32:25,529 --> 01:32:27,460
You're not buying in?

693
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,529
No.

694
01:32:33,869 --> 01:32:37,810
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

695
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:40,670
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

696
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,967
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

697
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:48,920
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

698
01:32:50,289 --> 01:32:52,619
And what about the winnings?

699
01:32:53,329 --> 01:32:55,890
Does it look like we need the money?

700
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:09,529
Shall we up the blinds?

701
01:33:11,739 --> 01:33:13,439
Why not?

702
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,409
Bet.

703
01:33:20,489 --> 01:33:22,149
Raise.

704
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:39,600
And fold.

705
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,810
Excuse me, please.

706
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:47,140
Call.

707
01:33:48,609 --> 01:33:49,840
Raise.

708
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:53,510
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

709
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,960
- Fold.
- Thank you.

710
01:34:00,329 --> 01:34:01,489
Fold.

711
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,289
Fold.

712
01:34:12,199 --> 01:34:13,640
Thank you.

713
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:14,840
Wins.

714
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:37,090
Deal me out.

715
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,220
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

716
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:44,760
Small blind, please.

717
01:35:48,869 --> 01:35:51,270
- Who is it?
- It's 007.

718
01:35:52,939 --> 01:35:55,539
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

719
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:00,227
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

720
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:03,167
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

721
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:04,409
I'm all ears.

722
01:36:04,619 --> 01:36:06,267
Remove the defibrillator from the pouch.

723
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:08,900
- Do we know what it is yet?
- We're still scanning.

724
01:36:14,329 --> 01:36:17,060
Attach the leads to your chest.

725
01:36:25,699 --> 01:36:27,670
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

726
01:36:27,970 --> 01:36:30,896
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

727
01:36:30,979 --> 01:36:32,600
...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?

728
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:35,667
- As soon as it reads charged...
- Lidocaine. That'll work.

729
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:38,337
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

730
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:39,850
His heart's gonna stop.

731
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:42,700
There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.

732
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:47,289
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

733
01:36:47,489 --> 01:36:49,789
That'll counteract the digitalis.

734
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:55,017
You're going to pass out in a few seconds.

735
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,656
You need to keep your heart going.

736
01:36:56,739 --> 01:36:58,239
Push the red button now, Bond.

737
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:06,510
- Bond, push the damn button!
- Do it now!

738
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:56,359
- You okay?
- Me?

739
01:37:59,699 --> 01:38:02,289
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

740
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:06,159
- Now get yourself off to a hospital.
- I will do.

741
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:08,670
As soon as I've won this game.

742
01:38:08,770 --> 01:38:11,500
You're not seriously going back there?

743
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:15,979
I wouldn't dream of it.

744
01:38:17,619 --> 01:38:19,210
Bet. One million.

745
01:38:22,949 --> 01:38:24,510
- All in.
- Call. All in.

746
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,319
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

747
01:38:29,329 --> 01:38:31,229
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

748
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:37,600
Queen plays. Wins.

749
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:47,369
Oh, I'm sorry.

750
01:38:47,579 --> 01:38:50,140
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

751
01:38:51,579 --> 01:38:55,279
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

752
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:57,149
...which means no more buy-ins.

753
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:00,550
The big blind is now 1 million dollars.

754
01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:08,760
Four players.

755
01:39:11,569 --> 01:39:12,930
It's your bet.

756
01:39:16,979 --> 01:39:18,179
- Monsieur Bond?
- Check.

757
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:22,180
- Check.
- Twenty-four million in the pot already.

758
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:27,180
Check. And check.

759
01:39:27,619 --> 01:39:29,210
All check.

760
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:30,750
Four players.

761
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,159
- Check.
- Check.

762
01:39:43,069 --> 01:39:45,229
All in. Six million.

763
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:48,659
Bet. Six million. All in.

764
01:39:54,109 --> 01:39:56,439
Five million. All in.

765
01:39:56,649 --> 01:39:59,210
Bet is 6 million.

766
01:40:06,729 --> 01:40:08,060
Raise.

767
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:10,819
Raise.

768
01:40:11,029 --> 01:40:14,289
Twelve million. Heads up.

769
01:40:44,899 --> 01:40:48,020
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

770
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:52,300
Raise. All in.

771
01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:14,779
Well, I think I will call you on that one.

772
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:22,829
Call.

773
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:38,909
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

774
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:41,850
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

775
01:41:45,489 --> 01:41:47,420
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

776
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,989
Full house. Eights full of aces.

777
01:42:17,159 --> 01:42:19,279
A higher full house.

778
01:42:19,489 --> 01:42:20,960
Aces full of sixes.

779
01:42:26,970 --> 01:42:28,159
Monsieur Bond.

780
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:47,710
Five and seven of spades.

781
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,390
A straight flush.

782
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:50,880
Four to the eight.

783
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:53,180
The high hand.

784
01:42:57,899 --> 01:42:59,420
Monsieur Bond wins.

785
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:02,729
- For you.
- Thank you very much.

786
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:06,359
Congratulations.

787
01:43:06,569 --> 01:43:10,100
- He's all yours.
- Much appreciated, brother.

788
01:43:17,079 --> 01:43:18,239
Congratulations.

789
01:43:18,449 --> 01:43:20,437
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

790
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:23,039
You were almost dead an hour ago.

791
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,909
Come on, I'm famished.

792
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:39,199
Thank you.

793
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:50,710
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

794
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:53,539
They're going to extract him before dawn.

795
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:56,350
You know, I think I'll call that a Vesper.

796
01:43:57,619 --> 01:43:59,420
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

797
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:03,789
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

798
01:44:06,399 --> 01:44:09,649
- I thought that was quite a good line.
- It was a very good line.

799
01:44:10,739 --> 01:44:12,229
But you're laughing at it.

800
01:44:12,569 --> 01:44:16,840
- Not so much it as you.
- Well, that's fine then.

801
01:44:23,149 --> 01:44:24,710
I figured out what that is.

802
01:44:27,149 --> 01:44:29,420
It's an Algerian love knot.

803
01:44:29,619 --> 01:44:32,819
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

804
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:34,649
No, you didn't.

805
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,029
Someone gave that to you.

806
01:44:40,729 --> 01:44:42,460
He's a very lucky man.

807
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:51,810
You can switch off so easily, can't you?

808
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:54,369
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

809
01:44:54,979 --> 01:44:58,010
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

810
01:44:58,949 --> 01:45:01,180
I don't believe you.

811
01:45:01,819 --> 01:45:03,979
You've got a choice, you know?

812
01:45:04,189 --> 01:45:05,906
Just because you've done something...

813
01:45:05,989 --> 01:45:08,119
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

814
01:45:08,329 --> 01:45:11,347
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

815
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:13,399
You think I can't take my own advice?

816
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,960
I think something is driving you.

817
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,700
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

818
01:45:25,479 --> 01:45:27,600
Mathis needs me.

819
01:45:28,279 --> 01:45:29,539
Good night.

820
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:31,079
Congratulations again.

821
01:45:50,369 --> 01:45:52,199
Mathis.

822
01:47:44,149 --> 01:47:48,079
I'm afraid your friend Mathis is really...

823
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:51,149
...my friend Mathis.

824
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:36,659
You've taken good care of your body.

825
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:45,689
Such a waste.

826
01:50:02,949 --> 01:50:04,789
You know...

827
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:08,279
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

828
01:50:08,489 --> 01:50:10,689
It's the simplest thing...

829
01:50:10,899 --> 01:50:14,420
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

830
01:50:15,930 --> 01:50:17,090
And of course...

831
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:20,270
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

832
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:23,130
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

833
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:27,470
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

834
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:35,449
The only question remains...

835
01:50:36,949 --> 01:50:39,119
...will you yield in time?

836
01:50:41,189 --> 01:50:44,319
I want the money.

837
01:51:03,050 --> 01:51:06,479
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

838
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:09,050
So all I need from you is the password.

839
01:51:18,829 --> 01:51:22,060
The password, please.

840
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:28,600
I've got a little itch...

841
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:30,670
...down there.

842
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:32,909
Would you mind?

843
01:51:40,649 --> 01:51:44,050
No! No! No!

844
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:48,720
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

845
01:51:48,930 --> 01:51:51,359
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

846
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:54,789
Yeah!

847
01:51:56,029 --> 01:51:59,329
Yes, yes, yes.

848
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:10,449
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

849
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:13,739
I died?

850
01:52:13,949 --> 01:52:15,250
- I died?
- Yes.

851
01:52:15,449 --> 01:52:18,536
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

852
01:52:18,619 --> 01:52:20,576
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

853
01:52:20,659 --> 01:52:23,606
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

854
01:52:23,689 --> 01:52:25,090
Because if you kill me...

855
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:27,359
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

856
01:52:27,569 --> 01:52:30,359
But you are so wrong!

857
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,687
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

858
01:52:33,770 --> 01:52:36,569
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

859
01:52:38,109 --> 01:52:41,739
...because they need what I know.

860
01:52:42,979 --> 01:52:45,039
The big picture.

861
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:55,189
Give me the password...

862
01:52:55,390 --> 01:52:57,329
...and I will at least let her live.

863
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,090
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

864
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:19,330
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

865
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,310
No.

866
01:53:23,149 --> 01:53:25,050
So I think...

867
01:53:29,590 --> 01:53:33,029
...I'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

868
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:48,439
I'll get the money.

869
01:53:49,350 --> 01:53:51,840
Tell them I'll get the money.

870
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:56,510
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

871
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:21,539
Francesco.

872
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:24,380
Francesco.

873
01:54:37,090 --> 01:54:39,220
Vesper.

874
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:43,000
Vesper.

875
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:46,659
No.

876
01:54:47,470 --> 01:54:48,800
Not him.

877
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:50,909
Not Mathis.

878
01:54:52,739 --> 01:54:53,899
No.

879
01:54:54,750 --> 01:54:56,770
I'll get the doctor.

880
01:54:59,550 --> 01:55:01,350
Not him.

881
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:04,409
Any ideas?

882
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:11,989
- What?
- Why they left the two of you alive.

883
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,430
Where is she?

884
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:18,369
Sleeping.

885
01:55:18,970 --> 01:55:22,229
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

886
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:25,000
It's just odd...

887
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:29,109
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

888
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:32,649
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

889
01:55:33,819 --> 01:55:35,939
Get a look at the killer?

890
01:55:36,489 --> 01:55:38,220
No.

891
01:55:39,689 --> 01:55:41,119
Shame.

892
01:55:42,789 --> 01:55:44,520
Drink up.

893
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:50,090
Anything else you remember?

894
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:52,329
Anything that can help us?

895
01:55:52,539 --> 01:55:54,159
Help us?

896
01:55:54,369 --> 01:55:56,600
Or help you?

897
01:56:36,979 --> 01:56:38,140
Hello.

898
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:40,180
Hello.

899
01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:43,180
You all right?

900
01:56:43,819 --> 01:56:45,979
I can't resist waking you.

901
01:56:46,189 --> 01:56:50,819
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

902
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:53,949
It makes me feel reborn.

903
01:56:57,699 --> 01:57:00,800
If you'd just been born...

904
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:03,739
...wouldn't you be naked?

905
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:06,699
You have me there.

906
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:12,079
You can have me anywhere.

907
01:57:14,149 --> 01:57:15,680
I can?

908
01:57:15,890 --> 01:57:19,750
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

909
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:23,659
Does this mean that you're warming to me?

910
01:57:23,859 --> 01:57:26,060
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

911
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:27,816
It's just that not so long ago...

912
01:57:27,899 --> 01:57:31,770
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as...

913
01:57:33,239 --> 01:57:35,869
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

914
01:57:36,439 --> 01:57:39,340
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

915
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:42,369
That is something to be afraid of.

916
01:57:45,149 --> 01:57:48,779
- Hello.
- Oh, perfect timing.

917
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:52,949
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

918
01:57:53,159 --> 01:57:55,149
My apologies, I do not mean to rush...

919
01:57:55,359 --> 01:57:57,459
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

920
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:00,410
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

921
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:02,720
I'm afraid not.

922
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:06,800
If you would type in the account number.

923
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,279
And now the password.

924
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:17,239
You can do that.

925
01:58:17,949 --> 01:58:20,010
I would if I knew what it was.

926
01:58:20,619 --> 01:58:22,619
V-E-S-P-E-R.

927
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,630
The funds have been transferred.

928
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,699
Sorry for disturbing you.

929
01:58:44,539 --> 01:58:47,770
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

930
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:55,750
You know, James...

931
01:58:58,359 --> 01:59:01,377
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

932
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:04,760
...was your smile
and your little finger...

933
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:07,810
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

934
01:59:17,109 --> 01:59:20,770
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

935
01:59:23,649 --> 01:59:27,520
- I have no idea.
- But you're aching to find out.

936
01:59:30,789 --> 01:59:34,720
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

937
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:37,590
You've got your armor back on.

938
01:59:37,789 --> 01:59:39,020
That's that.

939
01:59:40,529 --> 01:59:43,090
I have no armor left.

940
01:59:44,329 --> 01:59:46,829
You've stripped it from me.

941
01:59:47,699 --> 01:59:50,170
Whatever is left of me...

942
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:53,510
Whatever is left of me...

943
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:56,310
...whatever I am...

944
01:59:56,510 --> 01:59:59,000
...I'm yours.

945
02:01:00,439 --> 02:01:03,439
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

946
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:06,010
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

947
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:07,409
Mathis?

948
02:01:07,619 --> 02:01:09,767
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

949
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:12,289
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

950
02:01:12,859 --> 02:01:14,409
That's how he wiped me out.

951
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:18,289
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

952
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:20,689
I can't believe it.

953
02:01:20,899 --> 02:01:22,489
No, neither could I.

954
02:01:22,970 --> 02:01:25,369
I thought he had my back.

955
02:01:26,039 --> 02:01:27,829
But there you go, lesson learned.

956
02:01:29,239 --> 02:01:31,640
Does everyone have a tell?

957
02:01:33,579 --> 02:01:35,310
Yes.

958
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:40,010
Everyone.

959
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:42,250
Everyone except you.

960
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:48,750
I wonder if that's why I love you.

961
02:01:50,789 --> 02:01:52,729
You love me?

962
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:55,646
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

963
02:01:55,729 --> 02:01:57,930
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

964
02:01:58,569 --> 02:02:02,630
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

965
02:02:03,539 --> 02:02:04,970
You're serious.

966
02:02:05,939 --> 02:02:07,840
Like you said...

967
02:02:08,409 --> 02:02:10,159
...you do what I do for too long...

968
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:13,109
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

969
02:02:13,319 --> 02:02:16,180
I'm leaving with what little I have left.

970
02:02:18,189 --> 02:02:20,279
Is that enough for you?

971
02:04:04,630 --> 02:04:06,529
- Come on.
- No. No.

972
02:04:07,029 --> 02:04:10,229
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

973
02:04:10,430 --> 02:04:12,630
What's the time?

974
02:04:14,869 --> 02:04:16,930
How much do we need to float for a month?

975
02:04:17,409 --> 02:04:19,170
I've got plenty.

976
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:23,310
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

977
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:28,579
You stopped wearing the necklace.

978
02:04:28,789 --> 02:04:31,949
Yeah. It was time.

979
02:04:32,159 --> 02:04:34,890
Time enough to get over someone?

980
02:04:39,659 --> 02:04:43,029
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

981
02:04:51,739 --> 02:04:53,640
Though apparently not your employer.

982
02:04:58,079 --> 02:05:01,310
Back in one month.

983
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:04,789
Come on. I'll get the money...

984
02:05:04,989 --> 02:05:07,149
...you get supplies.

985
02:05:36,819 --> 02:05:39,250
I'll see you back here in half an hour.

986
02:06:03,750 --> 02:06:06,180
- Hello, M.
- I got your note.

987
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:08,039
Yes?

988
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:10,079
We'll talk about that later.

989
02:06:10,289 --> 02:06:13,279
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

990
02:06:13,489 --> 02:06:16,339
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

991
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:22,600
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

992
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:26,100
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.

993
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:28,460
So you'll be depositing it today.

994
02:06:28,810 --> 02:06:31,430
On my way to the bank right now.

995
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:34,539
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

996
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:36,170
Hello.

997
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:37,480
Mr. Mendel?

998
02:06:37,631 --> 02:06:39,896
I'm having trouble accessing
the funds in my account.

999
02:06:39,979 --> 02:06:41,937
It was transferred
to the account number...

1000
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:44,319
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1001
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:50,359
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1002
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:55,010
- Where?
- The Venice branch, of course.

1003
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:56,329
St. Mark's Square.

1004
02:06:58,699 --> 02:07:00,399
Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?

1005
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:14,260
I'll kill her!

1006
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:16,470
Allow me.

1007
02:13:36,399 --> 02:13:38,369
I'm sorry, James.

1008
02:16:50,030 --> 02:16:52,760
She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.

1009
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:55,020
They were very much in love.

1010
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:58,559
He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.

1011
02:16:58,770 --> 02:17:03,729
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1012
02:17:03,940 --> 02:17:05,427
We should've picked up on it...

1013
02:17:05,510 --> 02:17:07,857
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1014
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:09,640
...we forget to watch our friends.

1015
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:12,979
How are you doing?

1016
02:17:13,319 --> 02:17:15,549
She left her cell phone.

1017
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:18,120
She must have known I'd check it.

1018
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:21,079
She knew you were you.

1019
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:24,389
- Well, at least this clears Mathis.
- No.

1020
02:17:24,590 --> 02:17:26,219
- No?
- No.

1021
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:29,046
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1022
02:17:29,129 --> 02:17:31,629
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1023
02:17:32,270 --> 02:17:34,156
You don't trust anyone, do you, James?

1024
02:17:34,239 --> 02:17:35,860
No.

1025
02:17:36,370 --> 02:17:38,639
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1026
02:17:39,440 --> 02:17:41,639
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1027
02:17:42,379 --> 02:17:43,540
Will do.

1028
02:17:45,819 --> 02:17:47,180
If you do need time...

1029
02:17:47,379 --> 02:17:48,779
Why should I need more time?

1030
02:17:49,790 --> 02:17:53,049
The job's done, and the bitch is dead.

1031
02:17:53,989 --> 02:17:55,790
James...

1032
02:17:56,430 --> 02:17:59,829
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

1033
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:02,120
Isn't it obvious?

1034
02:18:02,329 --> 02:18:06,290
She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.

1035
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:08,659
I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.

1036
02:18:10,239 --> 02:18:13,229
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1037
02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:17,280
And now we'll never know
who was behind this.

1038
02:18:17,479 --> 02:18:20,040
The trail's gone cold.

1039
02:19:47,569 --> 02:19:49,469
- Hello.
- Mr. White?

1040
02:19:49,670 --> 02:19:51,159
We need to talk.

1041
02:19:51,370 --> 02:19:53,239
Who is this?

1042
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:25,530
The name's Bond.

1043
02:20:25,739 --> 02:20:27,680
James Bond.

1044
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,500
...English...

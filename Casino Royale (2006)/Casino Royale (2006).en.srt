1
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,950
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,540
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,269
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

4
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,949
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,520
If M was so sure that I was bent...

6
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,659
...she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,070
Benefits of being section chief...

8
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,057
...I'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

9
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,430
...wouldn't I?

10
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,029
- Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
- Two.

11
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,990
Shame.

12
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,659
We barely got to know each other.

13
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,890
I know where you keep your gun.

14
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,930
I suppose that's something.

15
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,300
True.

16
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,539
How did he die?

17
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,210
Your contact?

18
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Not well.

19
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,860
Made you feel it, did he?

20
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,099
Well...

21
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,529
...you needn't worry.

22
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,659
The second is...

23
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,479
Yes.

24
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,339
Considerably.

25
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,549
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

26
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,320
You asked for the introduction.

27
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,750
That's all my organization will guarantee.

28
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:24,830
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

29
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,417
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

30
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,200
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

31
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,279
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

32
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,110
No.

33
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,980
I believe in a reasonable rate of return.

34
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,449
I want no risk in the portfolio.

35
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,919
Agreed.

36
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,137
And I can access it anywhere in the world?

37
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,319
Yes.

38
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,510
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

39
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:12,370
...of Skyfleet stock.

40
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:16,449
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

41
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,819
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

42
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,720
Just do it.

43
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,959
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

44
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:05,329
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

45
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,419
He's on the move.

46
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:24,549
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

47
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,409
Stop touching your ear.

48
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,679
- Sorry?
- Put your hand down.

49
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,719
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

50
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,926
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

51
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:14,409
...my dear general.

52
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,640
Nothing sinister.

53
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,280
All in.

54
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:29,209
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

55
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,519
...of making your straight.

56
00:20:57,949 --> 00:21:00,290
When does Ellipsis expire?

57
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:03,650
- We have less than 36 hours. I can...
- No. No, no.

58
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,590
That's all the time I have anyway.

59
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,530
Give our guests five minutes to leave...

60
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,030
...or throw them overboard.

61
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,380
Who the hell do they think they are?

62
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,166
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

63
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:30,567
...not to ask me what we do.

64
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,350
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

65
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,576
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

66
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:40,219
And how the hell could Bond be so stupid?

67
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,416
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

68
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:45,900
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

69
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,757
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

70
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,586
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

71
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,499
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

72
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,780
You've got a bloody cheek.

73
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,479
Sorry.

74
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:14,589
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

75
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:16,350
Or yourself.

76
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,580
You stormed into an embassy.

77
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,320
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

78
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,230
...of international relationships.

79
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,269
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

80
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:27,469
We wanted to question him, not kill him.

81
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:31,686
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

82
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:32,830
I did.

83
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:36,166
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

84
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,040
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

85
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,197
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

86
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,906
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

87
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,110
Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?

88
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,550
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

89
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,590
And thanks to your trigger finger...

90
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,659
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

91
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,210
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

92
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,116
The same way I found out your name.

93
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:02,257
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for...

94
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,810
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

95
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,999
I knew it was too early to promote you.

96
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,479
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy...

97
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,880
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

98
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,030
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

99
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:30,600
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

100
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:33,929
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

101
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,999
Any thug can kill.

102
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,659
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

103
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,330
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

104
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:45,310
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

105
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,140
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

106
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,507
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

107
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,076
...and think about your future.

108
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,060
Because these bastards want your head.

109
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,719
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

110
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,060
And Bond...

111
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,070
...don't ever break into
my house again.

112
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,949
Ma'am.

113
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,489
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

114
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:41,729
Hey. Hey.

115
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:55,540
Hello.

116
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,870
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

117
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,380
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

118
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,729
Security to car park.
Security to car park.

119
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:49,630
Absolutely incredible.

120
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:31,219
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

121
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:34,987
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

122
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,469
Okay.

123
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:41,340
- We have an ocean-view villa.
- Perfect.

124
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,780
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...

125
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,870
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

126
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,307
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know...?

127
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,820
- Mr. Dimitrios.
- Right.

128
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:58,876
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

129
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,809
Isn't the type to take bad news well.

130
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,499
But if I felt compelled to find him?

131
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,759
He has a house just up the beach.

132
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,699
Thank you.

133
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,499
- What?
- He's in the Bahamas.

134
00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:17,140
You woke me to share his holiday plans?

135
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,426
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

136
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:21,570
...using your name and password.

137
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,640
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

138
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,209
Well, I'm doing my best to find out.

139
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,280
- Who's he looking at?
- Alex Dimitrios.

140
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,310
That slimy bugger.

141
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,800
Now known associates...

142
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:58,949
Le Chiffre.

143
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,030
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

144
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:20,699
How can I assist you, sir?

145
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,250
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

146
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,086
- Look what just happened.
- Good job, big boy.

147
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:27,400
Yeah.

148
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,366
Do you mind if I join?

149
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:38,799
- Oh, good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.

150
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,269
Small blind, big blind.

151
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:54,130
I'm in.

152
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,229
Bet's to you.

153
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:03,669
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

154
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,509
Two hundred to you.

155
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,650
Bet's to you.

156
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,350
I heard you.

157
00:33:15,989 --> 00:33:17,749
Five to call.

158
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,777
- Action's to you.
- Pair of sevens.

159
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,229
Ace high.

160
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,370
Check or bet.

161
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,060
- Check.
- And to you.

162
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:31,209
Five thousand.

163
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,610
Five to call.

164
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,820
- Check.
- Check to you, sir.

165
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,820
All in.

166
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,290
No, wait.

167
00:33:56,699 --> 00:33:58,169
Twenty thousand.

168
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:00,900
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

169
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:07,499
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

170
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,039
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

171
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,240
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

172
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:26,189
All right, show me, gentlemen.

173
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,630
Three kings.

174
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,570
There you go with my night.

175
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,169
Trip aces.

176
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,470
Aces win.

177
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,510
Oh, and the valet ticket.

178
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,289
Thank you.

179
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,959
Sir.

180
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,459
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

181
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,660
No wonder he was in such a foul mood.

182
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,090
My mistake.

183
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,650
Can I give you a lift home?

184
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,599
That would really send him over the edge.

185
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,740
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

186
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:48,139
Well, perhaps you're just out of practice.

187
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,110
Perhaps.

188
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,170
Well, what about a drink at my place?

189
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,950
Your place?

190
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:05,220
- Is it close?
- Very.

191
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,499
One drink.

192
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,547
Good evening, sir, and welcome back.

193
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,530
Welcome to my home.

194
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,840
I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.

195
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,709
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

196
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:05,410
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

197
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,689
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

198
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,459
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

199
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,630
But I do care about my reputation.

200
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,829
I have someone else willing to do the job.

201
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,829
He just needs the particulars...

202
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:22,430
...and payment.

203
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:37,039
You like married women, don't you, James?

204
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:39,450
It keeps things simple.

205
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:45,189
What is it about bad men?

206
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:48,360
You, my husband...

207
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,229
I had so many chances to be happy...

208
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,800
...so many nice guys.

209
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:56,700
Why can't nice guys be more like you?

210
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,139
Well, because then they'd be bad.

211
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,340
Yes.

212
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,910
But so much more interesting.

213
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:14,789
What makes your husband a bad man?

214
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,550
His nature, I suppose.

215
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,419
The nature of his work?

216
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,289
A mystery, I'm afraid.

217
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:29,269
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

218
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,939
How afraid?

219
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,309
Not enough to stop.

220
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,050
Can I ask you a personal question?

221
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,380
Now would seem an appropriate time.

222
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,959
Does "ellipsis" mean anything to you?

223
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,269
Should I ask him about it?

224
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,800
Perhaps later.

225
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,939
Yes, dear?

226
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:11,139
I'm on the last flight tonight to Miami.

227
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,869
Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.

228
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,410
Okay, I understand.

229
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,380
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

230
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:25,329
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

231
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,689
...so you have all night
to question me.

232
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,999
In that case...

233
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,329
...we're gonna need...

234
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,900
...some more champagne.

235
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:45,209
Good evening. Room Service.

236
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,209
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

237
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:50,669
...and the beluga caviar?

238
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:53,320
- With everything?
- Yes, with everything.

239
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,610
- And would that be for two, sir?
- What?

240
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,090
- For two?
- No, for one.

241
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:33,919
Wait here.

242
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:41,160
There you go. Number 53.

243
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,510
Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors...

244
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:50,539
...to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive...

245
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:52,510
...nervous and vascular systems.

246
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,510
Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

247
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,410
I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.

248
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,780
This is edutainment.

249
00:42:29,139 --> 00:42:31,300
...fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses...

250
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,380
...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.

251
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,050
Hello.

252
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,169
Hello.

253
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,340
Do not leave your vehicle unattended.

254
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,110
Welcome to Miami International Airport.

255
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,439
Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted...

256
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,439
- Yes.
- It's Bond. I need her now.

257
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:52,400
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

258
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,976
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

259
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:58,809
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

260
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,760
- Sorry, can I put you on hold?
- I thought you might.

261
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,930
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

262
00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:12,769
I'll call you back.

263
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:37,900
- The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
- What about it?

264
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,849
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

265
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,769
Oh, my God!

266
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:25,570
Bond? Bond!

267
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:30,680
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

268
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,820
It's launching today.

269
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,019
I gotta go.

270
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,090
Stop! Stop!

271
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:08,849
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

272
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:46,619
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

273
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:52,220
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

274
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,930
Someone talked.

275
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,777
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah, I have.

276
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,919
I'm gonna get a few more photos...

277
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:46,340
Quite the body count you're stacking up.

278
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,996
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

279
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,709
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

280
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:55,637
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

281
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,720
No.

282
00:54:56,889 --> 00:55:00,349
- Not your name, what you were after?
- No.

283
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,117
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

284
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,077
Knew where to put his hands on weapons...

285
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,717
...and people who could use them.

286
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,547
He worked with anyone who had money.

287
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:10,999
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

288
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:13,226
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

289
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:16,769
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

290
00:55:16,979 --> 00:55:18,740
Oh, good. You're here.

291
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:21,510
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

292
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,280
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

293
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,039
So you can keep an eye on me?

294
00:55:58,389 --> 00:55:59,880
Yes.

295
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:07,919
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9.11...

296
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:11,430
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

297
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:15,459
When the stocks hit bottom on 9I12,
somebody made a fortune.

298
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:18,856
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

299
00:56:18,939 --> 00:56:20,169
...or was supposed to.

300
00:56:20,369 --> 00:56:24,139
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

301
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,369
Instead, somebody lost over
$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

302
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,280
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

303
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:34,536
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

304
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:36,320
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

305
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:40,579
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

306
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:43,559
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

307
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,320
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

308
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,617
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

309
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,970
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

310
00:56:53,169 --> 00:56:56,570
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

311
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,726
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

312
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:01,297
We can't let him win this game.

313
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,610
If he loses, he'll have nowhere to run.

314
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,720
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

315
00:57:06,849 --> 00:57:08,579
I'm putting you in the game...

316
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:11,450
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

317
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,220
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

318
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,459
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

319
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:26,439
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

320
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:29,800
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

321
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,340
No.

322
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,160
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

323
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,579
We'll know where you are.

324
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,150
You can stop pretending.

325
00:57:41,019 --> 00:57:43,269
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

326
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,519
Well, I knew you were you.

327
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:06,769
Thank you.

328
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:15,150
I'm the money.

329
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:18,720
Every penny of it.

330
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,560
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

331
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,289
"Vesper."

332
00:58:26,499 --> 00:58:29,049
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

333
00:58:29,769 --> 00:58:31,200
Thank you.

334
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,070
Your boss must be well-connected.

335
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:35,769
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

336
00:58:36,309 --> 00:58:37,939
Or quite so stylishly.

337
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,479
May I ask you where it is?

338
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,330
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

339
00:58:44,419 --> 00:58:48,749
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

340
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,106
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

341
00:58:52,189 --> 00:58:55,090
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

342
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:59,860
What looks good?

343
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,010
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

344
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,197
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

345
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,230
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

346
00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:17,579
So that would be what you call "bluffing"?

347
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,249
You've heard the term.

348
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:25,077
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

349
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,646
You play the man across from you.

350
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,129
- And you're good at reading people?
- Yes, I am.

351
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,117
Which is why I've been able to detect...

352
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,350
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

353
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,900
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

354
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,286
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

355
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:41,860
So there is a plan?

356
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,766
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

357
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:47,079
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

358
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,309
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

359
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,680
About you, Miss Lynd?

360
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:53,479
Well, your beauty's a problem.

361
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:55,950
You worry you won't be taken seriously.

362
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,150
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

363
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,047
True, but this one overcompensates...

364
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,077
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

365
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,646
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

366
01:00:05,729 --> 01:00:08,200
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor...

367
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,856
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

368
01:00:11,939 --> 01:00:14,130
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

369
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,110
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

370
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:21,639
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

371
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:25,067
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

372
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:27,809
...I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

373
01:00:30,789 --> 01:00:32,720
All right.

374
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:36,277
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

375
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,847
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

376
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:40,829
But you wear it with such disdain...

377
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:43,056
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

378
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,700
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

379
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:47,956
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

380
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:51,027
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

381
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,726
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

382
01:00:53,809 --> 01:00:55,800
...that's what I'd say you are.

383
01:00:59,749 --> 01:01:01,740
Oh, you are.

384
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,050
I like this poker thing.

385
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,019
And that makes perfect sense...

386
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:08,630
...since MI6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

387
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:11,217
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

388
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,490
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

389
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,789
You know...

390
01:01:14,999 --> 01:01:18,939
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

391
01:01:19,439 --> 01:01:21,809
- Rolex?
- Omega.

392
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:23,840
Beautiful.

393
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,010
Now, having just met you...

394
01:01:26,209 --> 01:01:29,166
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

395
01:01:29,249 --> 01:01:30,610
No, of course not.

396
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,637
But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine.

397
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,920
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

398
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,180
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

399
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,789
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

400
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,547
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

401
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,599
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

402
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,590
You noticed?

403
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,789
Even accountants have imagination.

404
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:51,329
How was your lamb?

405
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,300
Skewered.

406
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,130
One sympathizes.

407
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,470
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

408
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,010
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

409
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:19,499
- Hotel Splendid, sir?
- That's right.

410
01:02:21,769 --> 01:02:23,999
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

411
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:40,320
It's just last-minute details.

412
01:02:42,019 --> 01:02:43,769
Apparently we're very much in love.

413
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:47,577
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

414
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,360
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

415
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,729
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

416
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,617
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest...

417
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,016
- I am not.
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.

418
01:02:58,099 --> 01:03:00,070
Oh, no, I don't.

419
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:02,269
We've been involved for quite a while...

420
01:03:02,769 --> 01:03:04,530
...hence the shared suite.

421
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,110
But my family is strict Roman Catholic...

422
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:10,157
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

423
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,510
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

424
01:03:13,809 --> 01:03:16,209
Religion and a securely locked door.

425
01:03:16,419 --> 01:03:18,507
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

426
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:21,349
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

427
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:22,680
Smart?

428
01:03:23,289 --> 01:03:24,990
Single.

429
01:03:44,209 --> 01:03:46,327
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

430
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:49,280
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

431
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:52,209
- Welcome, Mr. Bond.
- You sign that, dear.

432
01:03:52,849 --> 01:03:55,189
You represent the Treasury.

433
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:02,189
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

434
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,990
I will. Thank you.

435
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:08,160
Very funny.

436
01:04:08,369 --> 01:04:10,456
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

437
01:04:10,539 --> 01:04:12,726
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

438
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:15,039
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

439
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,726
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

440
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:20,226
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

441
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:22,840
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

442
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,907
And now he knows something about you.

443
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,180
He knows you're reckless.

444
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:29,619
Take the next one.

445
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,689
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

446
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:34,650
Mr. Bond?

447
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:37,189
- It was left for you.
- Thank you.

448
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:09,849
I love you too, M.

449
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:54,240
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

450
01:05:57,749 --> 01:05:59,427
Does he know we've been watching him?

451
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:02,180
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

452
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,720
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

453
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:09,436
I'm afraid if you get into trouble here...

454
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:13,249
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

455
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,590
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

456
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:20,559
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

457
01:06:21,169 --> 01:06:24,099
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

458
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:26,209
That's him, with the mustache.

459
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,970
Over my left shoulder.

460
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,240
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

461
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,410
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

462
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:36,240
He's not a very subtle man.

463
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,610
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

464
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:43,019
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

465
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:52,289
I hate to say it...

466
01:06:52,499 --> 01:06:56,459
...but the accountants seem
to be running MI6 these days.

467
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:00,740
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

468
01:07:00,939 --> 01:07:03,209
Many of them are lovely people.

469
01:07:04,749 --> 01:07:07,840
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

470
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:11,639
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

471
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:16,189
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

472
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:21,749
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

473
01:07:27,229 --> 01:07:28,599
Yes?

474
01:07:29,269 --> 01:07:30,930
For you.

475
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:34,599
Something you expect me to wear?

476
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:38,479
I need you looking fabulous.

477
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:41,036
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

478
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,597
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

479
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,410
...and not about their cards.

480
01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:48,019
Do you think you can do that for me?

481
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:50,160
I'll do my best.

482
01:07:51,229 --> 01:07:53,160
Thank you.

483
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:06,400
I have a dinner jacket.

484
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,939
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

485
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:11,300
This is the latter.

486
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:14,709
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

487
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,780
How...?

488
01:08:17,589 --> 01:08:19,049
It's tailored.

489
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,809
I sized you up the moment we met.

490
01:09:15,509 --> 01:09:18,139
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

491
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,740
Thank you.

492
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:34,650
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

493
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,960
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

494
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:40,960
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

495
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:43,599
Well, we wouldn't want that, would we?

496
01:09:53,049 --> 01:09:55,040
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

497
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,839
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

498
01:09:58,049 --> 01:09:59,990
Five communal cards, two in the hole.

499
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:03,337
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

500
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,650
...holding the stakes.

501
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,490
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

502
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,716
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

503
01:10:12,799 --> 01:10:15,016
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

504
01:10:15,099 --> 01:10:17,957
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

505
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,240
...into the encryptor...

506
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,256
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

507
01:10:21,339 --> 01:10:23,739
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

508
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,769
Mr. Bond?

509
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,497
We proceed alphabetically.

510
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:30,330
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

511
01:10:38,429 --> 01:10:39,589
Six letters or more.

512
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,339
High card for dealer position.

513
01:11:02,379 --> 01:11:03,679
It's Signor Gallardo.

514
01:11:03,879 --> 01:11:06,910
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

515
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,580
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

516
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:14,719
Well, enjoy the game.

517
01:11:38,589 --> 01:11:39,679
Four players.

518
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:43,620
It's your bet.

519
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,629
Check.

520
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:48,620
Check.

521
01:11:52,929 --> 01:11:54,990
Bet. Fifty thousand.

522
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:09,479
Call.

523
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,019
Fold.

524
01:12:16,219 --> 01:12:18,620
Fold. Heads up.

525
01:12:22,929 --> 01:12:24,360
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

526
01:12:35,879 --> 01:12:38,439
Bet. One hundred thousand.

527
01:12:41,549 --> 01:12:44,540
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

528
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,780
Was I? Forgive me.

529
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,519
Good luck, darling.

530
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,729
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

531
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,889
Monsieur Bond?

532
01:13:00,099 --> 01:13:02,759
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

533
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:05,299
Call.

534
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:11,599
Hello.

535
01:13:11,809 --> 01:13:15,410
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

536
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:18,740
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

537
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:19,950
Champagne.

538
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,490
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

539
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:37,870
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

540
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:48,040
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

541
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:52,879
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

542
01:13:53,089 --> 01:13:54,879
Mr. Bond?

543
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:59,120
Fold.

544
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,830
Send the barman over, please.

545
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:19,780
A dry martini. Wait.

546
01:14:19,979 --> 01:14:21,796
Three measures Gordon's, one of vodka...

547
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:23,837
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

548
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,750
- ...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
- Yes, sir.

549
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,820
- You know, I'll have one of those.
- So will I.

550
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:32,019
Certainly.

551
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,860
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

552
01:14:37,729 --> 01:14:39,059
That's it?

553
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,960
Anyone want to play poker now?

554
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:43,330
Someone's in a hurry.

555
01:14:52,349 --> 01:14:54,280
Would you excuse me?

556
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:09,129
You taste nice.

557
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:12,259
- I thought we dispensed with covers.
- No.

558
01:15:12,469 --> 01:15:16,160
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

559
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:17,889
- Is he watching?
- Yes.

560
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:19,160
Good.

561
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:22,256
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

562
01:15:22,339 --> 01:15:24,110
...we won't be here past midnight.

563
01:15:24,309 --> 01:15:27,280
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

564
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:29,469
Check.

565
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,067
- You know, that's not half bad.
- Up to you.

566
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:34,250
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

567
01:15:35,589 --> 01:15:38,150
It was worth it to discover his tell.

568
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:39,750
What do you mean?

569
01:15:40,129 --> 01:15:42,179
The twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.

570
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:46,490
- Bluffs? He had the best hand.
- Which he got on the last card.

571
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,016
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

572
01:15:49,099 --> 01:15:51,186
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

573
01:15:51,269 --> 01:15:52,799
Winning was blind luck.

574
01:15:53,009 --> 01:15:54,839
- Did you get the bug?
- Yes.

575
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,910
Bet. One hundred thousand.

576
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:58,629
Thank you.

577
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:01,997
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

578
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,110
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

579
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:07,389
Call.

580
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,960
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

581
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:16,019
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

582
01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:18,117
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

583
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:22,660
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

584
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:57,269
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

585
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:00,740
So?

586
01:17:00,939 --> 01:17:03,070
You want to do what to me?

587
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,610
You've lost me completely.

588
01:17:04,809 --> 01:17:08,009
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

589
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:35,330
So, what's so damn important?

590
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,370
I'm sorry.

591
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,809
Where is my money?

592
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,676
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

593
01:17:49,759 --> 01:17:51,990
You're holding a parcel for me.

594
01:17:56,629 --> 01:17:58,290
Thank you.

595
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:03,729
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

596
01:18:04,269 --> 01:18:06,070
Your money is safe.

597
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:09,599
Open that.

598
01:18:25,629 --> 01:18:27,679
You'll have it tomorrow.

599
01:18:28,629 --> 01:18:29,929
All of it.

600
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:47,370
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

601
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,650
Hold out your arm.

602
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,719
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

603
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,950
...or I will take your head.

604
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:11,799
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

605
01:19:25,150 --> 01:19:26,150
Stairs.

606
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,250
Not a word of protest.

607
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:36,420
You should find a new boyfriend.

608
01:21:38,589 --> 01:21:40,280
Go find Mathis.

609
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:43,837
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

610
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,950
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

611
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:52,379
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

612
01:22:52,729 --> 01:22:56,420
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

613
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:57,860
A little.

614
01:22:58,059 --> 01:23:01,659
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

615
01:23:01,839 --> 01:23:05,860
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

616
01:24:07,099 --> 01:24:11,469
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

617
01:24:12,509 --> 01:24:14,370
Here, let's see.

618
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,790
That's better.

619
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,189
You cold?

620
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,799
Yeah.

621
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,900
Here.

622
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,889
You have any trouble with the bodies?

623
01:25:40,259 --> 01:25:42,389
Less than some.

624
01:25:56,179 --> 01:25:59,910
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

625
01:26:00,849 --> 01:26:03,540
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

626
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:06,150
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

627
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,849
How's our girl?

628
01:26:10,389 --> 01:26:13,589
Melted your cold heart yet?

629
01:26:31,509 --> 01:26:32,710
Call.

630
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:34,309
Fold.

631
01:26:34,509 --> 01:26:36,479
And call.

632
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,839
Three players.

633
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:45,219
Three hundred grand.

634
01:26:45,429 --> 01:26:47,089
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

635
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,620
Call.

636
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:53,370
And call.

637
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,799
Three players.

638
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:05,139
Check.

639
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:11,809
Monsieur Bond?

640
01:27:21,689 --> 01:27:24,129
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

641
01:27:35,809 --> 01:27:40,110
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

642
01:27:40,309 --> 01:27:42,339
My God, James was right.

643
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:45,379
It's up to you.

644
01:27:51,519 --> 01:27:53,920
Raise. One million.

645
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,370
Seems someone knows something I don't.

646
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,599
Fold.

647
01:28:05,809 --> 01:28:07,570
Heads up, gentlemen.

648
01:28:07,769 --> 01:28:09,330
It's up to you.

649
01:28:23,519 --> 01:28:24,990
Two.

650
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:27,849
Re-raise. Two million.

651
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:31,889
And it's up to you.

652
01:28:42,979 --> 01:28:44,839
I'm all in.

653
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,620
Well, it's 14 million and 500,000.

654
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:57,150
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

655
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:04,160
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

656
01:29:05,099 --> 01:29:07,830
- Call.
- Call.

657
01:29:08,269 --> 01:29:10,629
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

658
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:14,769
Full house. Kings and aces.

659
01:29:14,969 --> 01:29:17,000
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

660
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:33,650
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

661
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:40,830
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

662
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,660
Please.

663
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:45,170
We will now break for one hour.

664
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:48,700
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

665
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:57,809
Good game.

666
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:29,280
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

667
01:30:29,849 --> 01:30:32,179
I can't do that, James.

668
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:35,120
Look, I made a mistake.

669
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,910
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

670
01:30:39,129 --> 01:30:40,559
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

671
01:30:41,629 --> 01:30:43,059
Sorry?

672
01:30:43,259 --> 01:30:45,030
Try putting that in a sentence.

673
01:30:45,229 --> 01:30:46,747
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

674
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:49,287
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

675
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:52,429
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

676
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:54,040
That's what this is about.

677
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,240
All you're going to do now is lose more.

678
01:30:56,839 --> 01:30:58,000
Then you're an idiot.

679
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:01,080
- I'm sorry?
- I said, you're a bloody idiot.

680
01:31:02,979 --> 01:31:05,250
Look in my eyes.

681
01:31:06,019 --> 01:31:07,780
I can beat this man, you know that.

682
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:13,019
Get your hand off my arm.

683
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,080
Vodka martini.

684
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,080
- Shaken or stirred?
- Do I look like I give a damn?

685
01:31:58,269 --> 01:32:00,540
- James.
- Get the girl out.

686
01:32:07,809 --> 01:32:08,809
Funny game, right?

687
01:32:08,979 --> 01:32:12,080
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

688
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:15,910
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

689
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,447
You should have a little faith.

690
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:22,146
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

691
01:32:22,229 --> 01:32:24,490
Had. Excuse me.

692
01:32:24,929 --> 01:32:26,860
You're not buying in?

693
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:29,929
No.

694
01:32:33,269 --> 01:32:37,210
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

695
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:40,070
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

696
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:43,367
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

697
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:48,320
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

698
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:52,019
And what about the winnings?

699
01:32:52,729 --> 01:32:55,290
Does it look like we need the money?

700
01:33:06,839 --> 01:33:08,929
Shall we up the blinds?

701
01:33:11,139 --> 01:33:12,839
Why not?

702
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,809
Bet.

703
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:21,549
Raise.

704
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:39,000
And fold.

705
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,210
Excuse me, please.

706
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,540
Call.

707
01:33:48,009 --> 01:33:49,240
Raise.

708
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:52,910
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

709
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,360
- Fold.
- Thank you.

710
01:33:59,729 --> 01:34:00,889
Fold.

711
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,689
Fold.

712
01:34:11,599 --> 01:34:13,040
Thank you.

713
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,240
Wins.

714
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:36,490
Deal me out.

715
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:40,620
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

716
01:34:42,599 --> 01:34:44,160
Small blind, please.

717
01:35:48,269 --> 01:35:50,670
- Who is it?
- It's 007.

718
01:35:52,339 --> 01:35:54,939
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

719
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,627
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

720
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:02,567
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

721
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:03,809
I'm all ears.

722
01:36:04,019 --> 01:36:05,667
Remove the defibrillator from the pouch.

723
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:08,300
- Do we know what it is yet?
- We're still scanning.

724
01:36:13,729 --> 01:36:16,460
Attach the leads to your chest.

725
01:36:25,099 --> 01:36:27,070
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

726
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:30,296
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

727
01:36:30,379 --> 01:36:32,000
...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?

728
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:35,067
- As soon as it reads charged...
- Lidocaine. That'll work.

729
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:37,737
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

730
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,250
His heart's gonna stop.

731
01:36:39,450 --> 01:36:42,100
There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.

732
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:46,689
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

733
01:36:46,889 --> 01:36:49,189
That'll counteract the digitalis.

734
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,417
You're going to pass out in a few seconds.

735
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,056
You need to keep your heart going.

736
01:36:56,139 --> 01:36:57,639
Push the red button now, Bond.

737
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:05,910
- Bond, push the damn button!
- Do it now!

738
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:55,759
- You okay?
- Me?

739
01:37:59,099 --> 01:38:01,689
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

740
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:05,559
- Now get yourself off to a hospital.
- I will do.

741
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:08,070
As soon as I've won this game.

742
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:10,900
You're not seriously going back there?

743
01:38:13,479 --> 01:38:15,379
I wouldn't dream of it.

744
01:38:17,019 --> 01:38:18,610
Bet. One million.

745
01:38:22,349 --> 01:38:23,910
- All in.
- Call. All in.

746
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,719
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

747
01:38:28,729 --> 01:38:30,629
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

748
01:38:34,570 --> 01:38:37,000
Queen plays. Wins.

749
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:46,769
Oh, I'm sorry.

750
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:49,540
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

751
01:38:50,979 --> 01:38:54,679
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

752
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:56,549
...which means no more buy-ins.

753
01:38:56,759 --> 01:38:59,950
The big blind is now 1 million dollars.

754
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:08,160
Four players.

755
01:39:10,969 --> 01:39:12,330
It's your bet.

756
01:39:16,379 --> 01:39:17,579
- Monsieur Bond?
- Check.

757
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:21,580
- Check.
- Twenty-four million in the pot already.

758
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:26,580
Check. And check.

759
01:39:27,019 --> 01:39:28,610
All check.

760
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:30,150
Four players.

761
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,559
- Check.
- Check.

762
01:39:42,469 --> 01:39:44,629
All in. Six million.

763
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:48,059
Bet. Six million. All in.

764
01:39:53,509 --> 01:39:55,839
Five million. All in.

765
01:39:56,049 --> 01:39:58,610
Bet is 6 million.

766
01:40:06,129 --> 01:40:07,460
Raise.

767
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:10,219
Raise.

768
01:40:10,429 --> 01:40:13,689
Twelve million. Heads up.

769
01:40:44,299 --> 01:40:47,420
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

770
01:40:49,870 --> 01:40:51,700
Raise. All in.

771
01:41:10,589 --> 01:41:14,179
Well, I think I will call you on that one.

772
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:22,229
Call.

773
01:41:34,110 --> 01:41:38,309
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

774
01:41:38,519 --> 01:41:41,250
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

775
01:41:44,889 --> 01:41:46,820
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

776
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,389
Full house. Eights full of aces.

777
01:42:16,559 --> 01:42:18,679
A higher full house.

778
01:42:18,889 --> 01:42:20,360
Aces full of sixes.

779
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:27,559
Monsieur Bond.

780
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:47,110
Five and seven of spades.

781
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:48,790
A straight flush.

782
01:42:48,990 --> 01:42:50,280
Four to the eight.

783
01:42:50,490 --> 01:42:52,580
The high hand.

784
01:42:57,299 --> 01:42:58,820
Monsieur Bond wins.

785
01:42:59,830 --> 01:43:02,129
- For you.
- Thank you very much.

786
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:05,759
Congratulations.

787
01:43:05,969 --> 01:43:09,500
- He's all yours.
- Much appreciated, brother.

788
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:17,639
Congratulations.

789
01:43:17,849 --> 01:43:19,837
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

790
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,439
You were almost dead an hour ago.

791
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:26,309
Come on, I'm famished.

792
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:38,599
Thank you.

793
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:50,110
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

794
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,939
They're going to extract him before dawn.

795
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:55,750
You know, I think I'll call that a Vesper.

796
01:43:57,019 --> 01:43:58,820
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

797
01:43:59,019 --> 01:44:03,189
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

798
01:44:05,799 --> 01:44:09,049
- I thought that was quite a good line.
- It was a very good line.

799
01:44:10,139 --> 01:44:11,629
But you're laughing at it.

800
01:44:11,969 --> 01:44:16,240
- Not so much it as you.
- Well, that's fine then.

801
01:44:22,549 --> 01:44:24,110
I figured out what that is.

802
01:44:26,549 --> 01:44:28,820
It's an Algerian love knot.

803
01:44:29,019 --> 01:44:32,219
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

804
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:34,049
No, you didn't.

805
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,429
Someone gave that to you.

806
01:44:40,129 --> 01:44:41,860
He's a very lucky man.

807
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:51,210
You can switch off so easily, can't you?

808
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:53,769
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

809
01:44:54,379 --> 01:44:57,410
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

810
01:44:58,349 --> 01:45:00,580
I don't believe you.

811
01:45:01,219 --> 01:45:03,379
You've got a choice, you know?

812
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:05,306
Just because you've done something...

813
01:45:05,389 --> 01:45:07,519
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

814
01:45:07,729 --> 01:45:10,747
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

815
01:45:10,830 --> 01:45:12,799
You think I can't take my own advice?

816
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:16,360
I think something is driving you.

817
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:19,100
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

818
01:45:24,879 --> 01:45:27,000
Mathis needs me.

819
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:28,939
Good night.

820
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:30,479
Congratulations again.

821
01:45:49,769 --> 01:45:51,599
Mathis.

822
01:47:43,549 --> 01:47:47,479
I'm afraid your friend Mathis is really...

823
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:50,549
...my friend Mathis.

824
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:36,059
You've taken good care of your body.

825
01:49:42,599 --> 01:49:45,089
Such a waste.

826
01:50:02,349 --> 01:50:04,189
You know...

827
01:50:04,559 --> 01:50:07,679
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

828
01:50:07,889 --> 01:50:10,089
It's the simplest thing...

829
01:50:10,299 --> 01:50:13,820
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

830
01:50:15,330 --> 01:50:16,490
And of course...

831
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:19,670
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

832
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:22,530
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

833
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:26,870
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

834
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:34,849
The only question remains...

835
01:50:36,349 --> 01:50:38,519
...will you yield in time?

836
01:50:40,589 --> 01:50:43,719
I want the money.

837
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:05,879
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

838
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,450
So all I need from you is the password.

839
01:51:18,229 --> 01:51:21,460
The password, please.

840
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:28,000
I've got a little itch...

841
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:30,070
...down there.

842
01:51:30,839 --> 01:51:32,309
Would you mind?

843
01:51:40,049 --> 01:51:43,450
No! No! No!

844
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:48,120
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

845
01:51:48,330 --> 01:51:50,759
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

846
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:54,189
Yeah!

847
01:51:55,429 --> 01:51:58,729
Yes, yes, yes.

848
01:52:04,410 --> 01:52:09,849
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

849
01:52:11,150 --> 01:52:13,139
I died?

850
01:52:13,349 --> 01:52:14,650
- I died?
- Yes.

851
01:52:14,849 --> 01:52:17,936
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

852
01:52:18,019 --> 01:52:19,976
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

853
01:52:20,059 --> 01:52:23,006
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

854
01:52:23,089 --> 01:52:24,490
Because if you kill me...

855
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:26,759
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

856
01:52:26,969 --> 01:52:29,759
But you are so wrong!

857
01:52:29,969 --> 01:52:33,087
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

858
01:52:33,170 --> 01:52:35,969
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

859
01:52:37,509 --> 01:52:41,139
...because they need what I know.

860
01:52:42,379 --> 01:52:44,439
The big picture.

861
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:54,589
Give me the password...

862
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:56,729
...and I will at least let her live.

863
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:03,490
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

864
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:18,730
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

865
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,710
No.

866
01:53:22,549 --> 01:53:24,450
So I think...

867
01:53:28,990 --> 01:53:32,429
...I'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

868
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:47,839
I'll get the money.

869
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:51,240
Tell them I'll get the money.

870
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:55,910
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

871
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:20,939
Francesco.

872
01:54:21,879 --> 01:54:23,780
Francesco.

873
01:54:36,490 --> 01:54:38,620
Vesper.

874
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,400
Vesper.

875
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:46,059
No.

876
01:54:46,870 --> 01:54:48,200
Not him.

877
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:50,309
Not Mathis.

878
01:54:52,139 --> 01:54:53,299
No.

879
01:54:54,150 --> 01:54:56,170
I'll get the doctor.

880
01:54:58,950 --> 01:55:00,750
Not him.

881
01:55:02,650 --> 01:55:03,809
Any ideas?

882
01:55:07,559 --> 01:55:11,389
- What?
- Why they left the two of you alive.

883
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,830
Where is she?

884
01:55:15,870 --> 01:55:17,769
Sleeping.

885
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:21,629
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

886
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:24,400
It's just odd...

887
01:55:24,610 --> 01:55:28,509
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

888
01:55:28,710 --> 01:55:32,049
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

889
01:55:33,219 --> 01:55:35,339
Get a look at the killer?

890
01:55:35,889 --> 01:55:37,620
No.

891
01:55:39,089 --> 01:55:40,519
Shame.

892
01:55:42,189 --> 01:55:43,920
Drink up.

893
01:55:47,330 --> 01:55:49,490
Anything else you remember?

894
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:51,729
Anything that can help us?

895
01:55:51,939 --> 01:55:53,559
Help us?

896
01:55:53,769 --> 01:55:56,000
Or help you?

897
01:56:36,379 --> 01:56:37,540
Hello.

898
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:39,580
Hello.

899
01:56:41,290 --> 01:56:42,580
You all right?

900
01:56:43,219 --> 01:56:45,379
I can't resist waking you.

901
01:56:45,589 --> 01:56:50,219
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

902
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,349
It makes me feel reborn.

903
01:56:57,099 --> 01:57:00,200
If you'd just been born...

904
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:03,139
...wouldn't you be naked?

905
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:06,099
You have me there.

906
01:57:08,780 --> 01:57:11,479
You can have me anywhere.

907
01:57:13,549 --> 01:57:15,080
I can?

908
01:57:15,290 --> 01:57:19,150
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

909
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:23,059
Does this mean that you're warming to me?

910
01:57:23,259 --> 01:57:25,460
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

911
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:27,216
It's just that not so long ago...

912
01:57:27,299 --> 01:57:31,170
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as...

913
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:35,269
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

914
01:57:35,839 --> 01:57:38,740
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

915
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,769
That is something to be afraid of.

916
01:57:44,549 --> 01:57:48,179
- Hello.
- Oh, perfect timing.

917
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:52,349
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

918
01:57:52,559 --> 01:57:54,549
My apologies, I do not mean to rush...

919
01:57:54,759 --> 01:57:56,859
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

920
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:59,810
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

921
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,120
I'm afraid not.

922
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:06,200
If you would type in the account number.

923
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,679
And now the password.

924
01:58:15,479 --> 01:58:16,639
You can do that.

925
01:58:17,349 --> 01:58:19,410
I would if I knew what it was.

926
01:58:20,019 --> 01:58:22,019
V-E-S-P-E-R.

927
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:39,030
The funds have been transferred.

928
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:42,099
Sorry for disturbing you.

929
01:58:43,939 --> 01:58:47,170
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

930
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:55,150
You know, James...

931
01:58:57,759 --> 01:59:00,777
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

932
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:04,160
...was your smile
and your little finger...

933
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:07,210
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

934
01:59:16,509 --> 01:59:20,170
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

935
01:59:23,049 --> 01:59:26,920
- I have no idea.
- But you're aching to find out.

936
01:59:30,189 --> 01:59:34,120
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

937
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:36,990
You've got your armor back on.

938
01:59:37,189 --> 01:59:38,420
That's that.

939
01:59:39,929 --> 01:59:42,490
I have no armor left.

940
01:59:43,729 --> 01:59:46,229
You've stripped it from me.

941
01:59:47,099 --> 01:59:49,570
Whatever is left of me...

942
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,910
Whatever is left of me...

943
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:55,710
...whatever I am...

944
01:59:55,910 --> 01:59:58,400
...I'm yours.

945
02:00:59,839 --> 02:01:02,839
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

946
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:05,410
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

947
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:06,809
Mathis?

948
02:01:07,019 --> 02:01:09,167
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

949
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:11,689
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

950
02:01:12,259 --> 02:01:13,809
That's how he wiped me out.

951
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:17,689
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

952
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:20,089
I can't believe it.

953
02:01:20,299 --> 02:01:21,889
No, neither could I.

954
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:24,769
I thought he had my back.

955
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:27,229
But there you go, lesson learned.

956
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:31,040
Does everyone have a tell?

957
02:01:32,979 --> 02:01:34,710
Yes.

958
02:01:37,650 --> 02:01:39,410
Everyone.

959
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:41,650
Everyone except you.

960
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:48,150
I wonder if that's why I love you.

961
02:01:50,189 --> 02:01:52,129
You love me?

962
02:01:52,660 --> 02:01:55,046
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

963
02:01:55,129 --> 02:01:57,330
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

964
02:01:57,969 --> 02:02:02,030
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

965
02:02:02,939 --> 02:02:04,370
You're serious.

966
02:02:05,339 --> 02:02:07,240
Like you said...

967
02:02:07,809 --> 02:02:09,559
...you do what I do for too long...

968
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:12,509
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

969
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:15,580
I'm leaving with what little I have left.

970
02:02:17,589 --> 02:02:19,679
Is that enough for you?

971
02:04:04,030 --> 02:04:05,929
- Come on.
- No. No.

972
02:04:06,429 --> 02:04:09,629
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

973
02:04:09,830 --> 02:04:12,030
What's the time?

974
02:04:14,269 --> 02:04:16,330
How much do we need to float for a month?

975
02:04:16,809 --> 02:04:18,570
I've got plenty.

976
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:22,710
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

977
02:04:25,650 --> 02:04:27,979
You stopped wearing the necklace.

978
02:04:28,189 --> 02:04:31,349
Yeah. It was time.

979
02:04:31,559 --> 02:04:34,290
Time enough to get over someone?

980
02:04:39,059 --> 02:04:42,429
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

981
02:04:51,139 --> 02:04:53,040
Though apparently not your employer.

982
02:04:57,479 --> 02:05:00,710
Back in one month.

983
02:05:01,790 --> 02:05:04,189
Come on. I'll get the money...

984
02:05:04,389 --> 02:05:06,549
...you get supplies.

985
02:05:36,219 --> 02:05:38,650
I'll see you back here in half an hour.

986
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:05,580
- Hello, M.
- I got your note.

987
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:07,439
Yes?

988
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:09,479
We'll talk about that later.

989
02:06:09,689 --> 02:06:12,679
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

990
02:06:12,889 --> 02:06:15,739
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

991
02:06:19,160 --> 02:06:22,000
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

992
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:25,500
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.

993
02:06:25,700 --> 02:06:27,860
So you'll be depositing it today.

994
02:06:28,210 --> 02:06:30,830
On my way to the bank right now.

995
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:33,939
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

996
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:35,570
Hello.

997
02:06:35,780 --> 02:06:36,880
Mr. Mendel?

998
02:06:37,031 --> 02:06:39,296
I'm having trouble accessing
the funds in my account.

999
02:06:39,379 --> 02:06:41,337
It was transferred
to the account number...

1000
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:43,719
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1001
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:49,759
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1002
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:54,410
- Where?
- The Venice branch, of course.

1003
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:55,729
St. Mark's Square.

1004
02:06:58,099 --> 02:06:59,799
Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?

1005
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:13,660
I'll kill her!

1006
02:09:14,670 --> 02:09:15,870
Allow me.

1007
02:13:35,799 --> 02:13:37,769
I'm sorry, James.

1008
02:16:49,430 --> 02:16:52,160
She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.

1009
02:16:52,359 --> 02:16:54,420
They were very much in love.

1010
02:16:54,830 --> 02:16:57,959
He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.

1011
02:16:58,170 --> 02:17:03,129
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1012
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:04,827
We should've picked up on it...

1013
02:17:04,910 --> 02:17:07,257
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1014
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:09,040
...we forget to watch our friends.

1015
02:17:10,510 --> 02:17:12,379
How are you doing?

1016
02:17:12,719 --> 02:17:14,949
She left her cell phone.

1017
02:17:15,150 --> 02:17:17,520
She must have known I'd check it.

1018
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:20,479
She knew you were you.

1019
02:17:21,559 --> 02:17:23,789
- Well, at least this clears Mathis.
- No.

1020
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:25,619
- No?
- No.

1021
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:28,446
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1022
02:17:28,529 --> 02:17:31,029
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1023
02:17:31,670 --> 02:17:33,556
You don't trust anyone, do you, James?

1024
02:17:33,639 --> 02:17:35,260
No.

1025
02:17:35,770 --> 02:17:38,039
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1026
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:41,039
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1027
02:17:41,779 --> 02:17:42,940
Will do.

1028
02:17:45,219 --> 02:17:46,580
If you do need time...

1029
02:17:46,779 --> 02:17:48,179
Why should I need more time?

1030
02:17:49,190 --> 02:17:52,449
The job's done, and the bitch is dead.

1031
02:17:53,389 --> 02:17:55,190
James...

1032
02:17:55,830 --> 02:17:59,229
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

1033
02:17:59,830 --> 02:18:01,520
Isn't it obvious?

1034
02:18:01,729 --> 02:18:05,690
She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.

1035
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:08,059
I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.

1036
02:18:09,639 --> 02:18:12,629
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1037
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:16,680
And now we'll never know
who was behind this.

1038
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:19,440
The trail's gone cold.

1039
02:19:46,969 --> 02:19:48,869
- Hello.
- Mr. White?

1040
02:19:49,070 --> 02:19:50,559
We need to talk.

1041
02:19:50,770 --> 02:19:52,639
Who is this?

1042
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:24,930
The name's Bond.

1043
02:20:25,139 --> 02:20:27,080
James Bond.

1044
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:32,900
...English...

1
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,759
Get Charlie.

2
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:45,564
Dr. Holloway!

3
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:49,777
Charlie!

4
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,493
What?

5
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:01,997
Come quick!

6
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:34,029
- Did you date it?
- Thirty-five thousand...

7
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:36,239
...years. Maybe older.

8
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:02,348
You gotta be kidding me.

9
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:06,978
It's the same configuration.

10
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:12,067
I mean, it's gotta predate
the others by millennia.

11
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:28,124
I think they want us
to come and find them.

12
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:31,920
Yeah.

13
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:40,404
What happened to that man?

14
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:41,656
He died.

15
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:44,533
Why aren't you helping them?

16
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:47,537
They don't want my help.

17
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:49,354
Their God is different than ours.

18
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,000
Why did he die?

19
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,867
Because sooner or later, everyone does.

20
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,254
Like Mummy?

21
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:00,466
Like Mummy.

22
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,886
Where do they go?

23
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:07,514
Everyone has their own word.

24
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:08,932
Heaven.

25
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,433
Paradise.

26
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,569
Whatever it's called,
it's someplace beautiful.

27
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,398
How do you know it's beautiful?

28
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,041
That's what l choose to believe.

29
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:21,904
What do you believe, Ellie?

30
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:58,065
Good morning, David.

31
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:00,609
Transmitting message.

32
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,614
No response.

33
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:16,833
Whilst this articulation...

34
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:19,754
...is attested in
the lndo-European descendants...

35
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,797
...as a purely paralinguistic form...

36
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:25,050
...it is phonemic in the ancestral form
dating back...

37
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:27,177
...five millennia or more.

38
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,494
Let's attempt Schleicher's fable.

39
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:30,679
Repeat after me.

40
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:45,153
Perfect.

41
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:48,032
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes?

42
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:50,409
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.

43
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:00,149
You do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood!

44
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:03,380
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

45
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:05,215
And you're barmy.

46
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:13,056
- Lt damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.

47
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:15,683
Well, what's the trick, then?

48
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,645
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

49
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,399
The trick, William Potter...

50
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:26,652
...is not minding that it hurts.

51
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:35,203
The trick, William Potter...

52
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:39,291
...is not minding that it hurts.

53
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,555
Attention:

54
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:56,182
Destination threshold.

55
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,683
Attention:

56
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,853
Destination threshold.

57
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,772
Attention: Destination threshold.

58
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,169
Robe.

59
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:18,931
How long?

60
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:21,475
Two years, four months, 18 days...

61
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:22,851
...36 hours, 15 minutes.

62
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,436
Any casualties?

63
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,105
Casualties, ma'am?

64
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,314
Has anyone died?

65
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:29,817
No, ma'am. Everyone is fine.

66
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:33,486
Well, then wake them up.

67
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:46,667
Try to relax, Dr. Shaw.

68
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:49,461
My name is David.

69
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,215
Your mind and body
are in a state of shock...

70
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:55,467
...as a result of the stasis.

71
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:57,594
It's all right. Perfectly normal.

72
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:58,636
Ellie.

73
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:01,222
We're here, baby.

74
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,395
There, there.

75
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,480
Drink plenty of water.
Drink plenty of fluids.

76
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,402
Hydration aids muscle mass.

77
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:21,660
All crew, consume shakes
with high caloric content.

78
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,084
What the hell is that?

79
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,046
It's Christmas.

80
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:34,613
We need the holidays...

81
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:36,356
...to show time is still moving.

82
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:37,416
Mission briefing...

83
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,093
...is about to start, captain.

84
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,180
Might wanna make your way down.

85
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,765
Well, l haven't had any breakfast yet.

86
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,642
Is this seat taken?

87
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,396
Hi, l'm Millburn, Biology.
Nice to meet you.

88
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:52,440
Okay.

89
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:56,027
Look, no offense, but...

90
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:58,613
...l've been asleep two years.

91
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,825
I ain't here to be your friend.

92
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,451
I'm here to make money.

93
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:05,912
You got that?

94
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:09,791
Okay.

95
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,837
I bet a hundred credits
it's a terraforming survey.

96
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:15,047
No, if it's a survey, they would tell us.

97
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,466
It's a corporate run,
they're not telling us shit.

98
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,383
Come on.

99
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,469
- A hundred.
- All right, you're on.

100
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,558
You look nervous, El.

101
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:30,062
- L'll try to keep my feet on the ground.
- L know you will.

102
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:31,062
Good morning.

103
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:34,357
For those of you l hired personally...

104
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:37,485
...it's nice to see you again.

105
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:42,327
For the rest of you, l am Meredith Vickers.
It's my job to make sure you do yours.

106
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:45,243
Okay, then. On with the show.

107
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:52,582
Weyland Corporation.

108
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,835
Building better worlds.

109
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:57,713
Hello, friends.

110
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:01,426
My name is Peter Weyland.

111
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:05,262
I am your employer.

112
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:10,560
I am recording this, 22 June, 2091.
And if you're watching it...

113
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:13,521
...you have reached your destination.

114
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:16,190
And l am long dead.

115
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:18,775
May l rest in peace.

116
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:23,155
There's a man sitting with you today.
His name is David.

117
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:26,367
And he is the closest thing to a son
l will ever have.

118
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,412
Unfortunately, he is not human.

119
00:16:29,745 --> 00:16:30,995
He will never grow old...

120
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:33,083
...and he will never die.

121
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:37,211
And yet he is unable to appreciate
these remarkable gifts...

122
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:41,715
...for that would require the one thing
that David will never have.

123
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:43,050
A soul.

124
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:45,761
I have spent my entire...

125
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,431
...lifetime contemplating the questions:

126
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:50,224
Where do we come from?

127
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:52,059
What is our purpose?

128
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:53,728
What happens when we die?

129
00:16:54,437 --> 00:16:58,587
And l have found two people who convinced
me they're on the verge of answering them.

130
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:02,028
Drs. Holloway and Shaw,
if you would please stand.

131
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:06,613
As far as you're concerned,
they're in charge.

132
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:12,120
The Titan Prometheus wanted to give
mankind equal footing with the gods...

133
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:15,875
...and for that, he was cast from Olympus.

134
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,589
Well, my friends,
the time has finally come for his return.

135
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,174
Doctors, please.

136
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:28,462
The floor is yours.

137
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,939
Okay, wow.

138
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:40,483
All right.

139
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,500
I never had to follow a ghost before.

140
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:44,862
Okay, let me show you why you guys...

141
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,155
...are here.

142
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:58,792
These are images of archeological digs
from all over the Earth.

143
00:17:58,959 --> 00:17:59,793
That's...

144
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,338
...Egyptian, Mayan, Sumerian, Babylonian.

145
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:06,383
That's Hawaiian there at the end,
then Mesopotamian.

146
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:09,636
Now, this one here
is our most recent discovery.

147
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:13,807
It's a 35,000-year-old cave painting
from the lsle of Skye in Scotland.

148
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:18,311
These are ancient civilizations.
They were separated by centuries.

149
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:21,565
They shared no contact with one another,
and yet...

150
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:26,486
The same pictogram...

151
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:30,281
...showing men worshipping giant beings,
pointing to the stars...

152
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,452
...was discovered
at every last one of them.

153
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:36,621
And the only galactic system
that matched...

154
00:18:37,664 --> 00:18:40,209
...was so far from Earth
that there's no way...

155
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:44,504
...that these primitive, ancient civilizations
could have possibly known about it.

156
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:46,172
But itjust so happens...

157
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:49,218
...that that system...

158
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:51,803
...has a sun...

159
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:54,264
...a lot like ours.

160
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:59,644
And, based on our long-range scans,
there seemed to be a planet.

161
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:03,314
Just one planet with a moon...

162
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:05,441
...capable of sustaining life.

163
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,945
And we arrived there this morning.

164
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:16,036
So you're saying we're here because of a map
you two kids found in a cave. ls that right?

165
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:18,580
- No.
- Yeah.

166
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:23,334
No. Not a map, an invitation.

167
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:24,877
From who?

168
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,131
We call them Engineers.

169
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,550
Engineers?

170
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:31,551
Do you mind...

171
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,388
...telling us what they engineered?

172
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,058
They engineered us.

173
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:41,645
Bullshit.

174
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:45,732
Okay, so do you...

175
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:47,567
...have anything to back that up?

176
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:50,176
Look, if you're willing to discount...

177
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,128
...centuries of Darwinism, that's...

178
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:56,283
But how do you know?

179
00:19:57,744 --> 00:19:59,078
I don't.

180
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,706
But it's what l choose to believe.

181
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:30,651
Doctors.

182
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:35,782
Miss Vickers would like to have
a quick word before the adventure begins.

183
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:44,247
Wow, nice place.

184
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:48,544
It's actually a separate module
with its own self-contained life support.

185
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:50,671
Air, food.

186
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:54,550
Anything Miss Vickers would need
to survive a hostile environment.

187
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:56,761
Okay, so she lives on a lifeboat.

188
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:57,970
Yes.

189
00:20:58,137 --> 00:20:58,804
I do.

190
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,224
I like to minimize risk.

191
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:05,394
David, why don't you make
the doctors a drink?

192
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,731
L'll take a vodka. Up.

193
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:10,566
Charlie, look.

194
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:13,109
It's a Pauling Med-Pod.

195
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,780
They only made a dozen of these.

196
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:16,780
Miss Shaw.

197
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:19,408
Please verbally state
the nature of your injury.

198
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:21,494
Please don't touch that.

199
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:23,711
It's a very expensive piece of machinery.

200
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:26,666
It does bypass surgery.
What do you need it for?

201
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:31,128
There might be some confusion
about our relationship.

202
00:21:32,213 --> 00:21:35,013
Weyland found you impressive enough
to fund this mission.

203
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:37,760
But l'm fairly certain your Engineers
are scribblings...

204
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:40,054
...of savages living
in dirty little caves.

205
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:44,605
But let's say l'm wrong,
and you do find these beings down there...

206
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:47,645
...you won't engage them...

207
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:49,438
...you won't talk to them.

208
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:52,316
You will do nothing but report back to me.

209
00:21:55,862 --> 00:21:58,114
Miss Vickers, is there an agenda that...

210
00:21:58,281 --> 00:21:59,907
...you're not telling us about?

211
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:01,158
My company...

212
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,953
...paid a trillion dollars to
find this place and bring you.

213
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:06,831
Had you raised the monies yourself,
Mr. Holloway...

214
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:09,875
...we'd happily be pursuing your agenda.

215
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,461
But you didn't.

216
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:14,463
And that makes you an employee.

217
00:22:15,922 --> 00:22:17,924
But if we can't make contact...

218
00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:20,594
...why did you even bring us here?

219
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:24,139
Weyland was a superstitious man.

220
00:22:24,848 --> 00:22:27,225
He wanted a true believer onboard.

221
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:31,103
Cheers.

222
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:35,567
So no response?

223
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:37,318
I'm sorry, no.

224
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:39,403
Maybe they didn't understand it.

225
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,824
How are your lessons going, David?

226
00:22:44,034 --> 00:22:47,579
I spent two years deconstructing
dozens of ancient languages...

227
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:49,915
...to their roots. l'm confident...

228
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:51,648
...l can communicate with them...

229
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,918
...provided your thesis is correct.

230
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:57,338
"Provided it's correct." That's good.

231
00:22:57,505 --> 00:23:00,425
That's why they call it a thesis, doctor.

232
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:05,221
What are you smiling about?

233
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:07,266
Mr. Ravel, Mr. Chance, take her down.

234
00:23:07,432 --> 00:23:08,934
- Roger that.
- Yes, captain.

235
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:10,769
Descent trajectory mapped.

236
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:12,479
How we doing?

237
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:13,731
Great.

238
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:15,815
All right, boss.

239
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:17,274
All personnel...

240
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:18,568
...this is the captain.

241
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:20,153
Brace for entry.

242
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,571
Yes, captain.

243
00:23:22,113 --> 00:23:23,614
That means you too, Vickers.

244
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:24,866
All systems...

245
00:23:25,116 --> 00:23:26,033
...online.

246
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,668
What is the atmosphere?

247
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:36,044
Atmosphere is...

248
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:37,462
...71 percent nitrogen...

249
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:38,797
...21 percent oxygen...

250
00:23:38,963 --> 00:23:40,113
...traces of argon gas.

251
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:42,342
Whoa, now, that's weather.

252
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,635
Just like home.

253
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:45,952
If you're breathing
through an exhaust pipe.

254
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:48,097
CO2 is over 3 percent.

255
00:23:48,264 --> 00:23:50,308
Two minutes without a suit, you're dead.

256
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:54,938
Peak portside.

257
00:23:55,188 --> 00:23:56,940
Whoa, 52,000!

258
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,317
It makes Everest look like a baby brother.

259
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,820
All right, take us around.

260
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,837
We'll use that as our point of entry.

261
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:08,410
Terrain data rezzing up. We've got...

262
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:09,995
...a couple of hard spots.

263
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:11,663
Could be metal.

264
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:33,724
No radio, no heat source.

265
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:35,853
Nobody's home.

266
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:38,754
There is nothing in the desert...

267
00:24:39,523 --> 00:24:41,191
...and no man needs nothing.

268
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,776
What was that?

269
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:46,112
Just something from a film l like.

270
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:51,951
Let's go through that gateway.

271
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,205
Reduce airspeed by a hundred knots.

272
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:01,629
Going through. Nice and slow.

273
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:08,719
Keep it steady, boys.

274
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:09,719
There.

275
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:11,721
No, what are you doing?

276
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:14,767
Dr. Holloway, why don't you take a seat?

277
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:18,020
Right there. God does not build in...

278
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:21,315
...straight lines.
Starboard side, this valley! Captain...

279
00:25:21,482 --> 00:25:23,032
...could you put us down there?

280
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:25,402
I wouldn't be any good
if l couldn't do that.

281
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:28,906
Mr. Ravel, starboard 90 degrees.

282
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:36,997
- One mile, port bow.
- One mile, port bow.

283
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:38,915
Engage landing sequence.

284
00:25:39,082 --> 00:25:40,208
Switch to manual.

285
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,627
- Commence landing.
- Easy.

286
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,754
- Roger that.
- Yeah, baby, yeah.

287
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:47,925
Bringing her down in five.

288
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:49,885
- Preparing RCS thrusters.
- Four.

289
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:55,266
Two. Easy does it.

290
00:26:12,908 --> 00:26:15,620
Generator systems are inactive.

291
00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:18,122
Temperature is at 2.724 K.

292
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:31,058
Captain, would you...

293
00:26:31,218 --> 00:26:33,220
...tell the survey team to suit up...

294
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:34,886
...and meet us in the airlock.

295
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:37,141
Only six hours left of daylight.

296
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:39,157
- Leave it till morning.
- No, no, no.

297
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,144
It's Christmas, captain...

298
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,188
...and l want to open my presents.

299
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,314
You, boy.

300
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:45,815
You're coming with us.

301
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:47,609
L'd be delighted.

302
00:26:53,156 --> 00:26:55,783
Attention: Ramp will open in five minutes.

303
00:26:57,994 --> 00:26:59,578
Hey, Jackson...

304
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:01,206
...what's that for?

305
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:02,998
Expedition security.

306
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:05,751
My job is to make sure
everybody is nice and safe.

307
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:10,298
This is a scientific expedition.
No weapons.

308
00:27:10,465 --> 00:27:11,508
All right, then.

309
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:13,259
Good luck with that.

310
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:18,171
David, why are you wearing a suit, man?

311
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:20,642
I beg your pardon?

312
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:22,477
You don't breathe, remember?

313
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,770
So why wear a suit?

314
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:27,524
I was designed like this...

315
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:31,903
...because you people are more comfortable
interacting with your own kind.

316
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:36,366
If l didn't wear the suit,
it would defeat the purpose.

317
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:39,425
They're making you guys pretty close, huh?

318
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:41,330
Not too close, l hope.

319
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:53,716
Attention: Ramp will open in 15 seconds.

320
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,807
Ramp will open in five...

321
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:05,019
...four, three, two, one.

322
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:23,746
Hey.

323
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:26,874
This is just one small step for mankind.

324
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:28,752
Seriously?

325
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:36,775
You ready to do this? l know you are.

326
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,355
Hey, Fifield.

327
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:49,815
I want a spectrograph on this.

328
00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:52,192
I want to know if it's natural
or if somebody put it there.

329
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:55,028
I can't tell you if it's natural or not.
But what l can...

330
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:57,237
...tell you is, it's hollow.

331
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:25,140
Prometheus, are you seeing this?

332
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:26,642
Affirmative.

333
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:28,269
We see it.

334
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:36,151
Okay, ready?

335
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,819
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

336
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:13,396
- After you.
- After you.

337
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:14,482
Okay.

338
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:15,691
Careful.

339
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,318
Prometheus, we're going in.

340
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:19,695
Copy that.

341
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,078
What's back here?

342
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,356
Some kind of a corridor?

343
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:59,859
Mr. Fifield,
let's get a grid of the structure.

344
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,403
I want the whole interior.

345
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,704
If there's anything in here
worth looking at...

346
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,215
...these pups'll find them.

347
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:07,742
"Pups"?

348
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,245
Yeah, pups. My pups.

349
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,804
Prometheus, we are now mapping.

350
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,184
Copy that.

351
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,580
Well, l'll be damned.

352
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:02,505
Fifield, you got a read?

353
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:03,798
Yeah.

354
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:07,510
Pups are saying this way.

355
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,488
Look at this.

356
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,456
Oh, Charlie.

357
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,502
Jesus.

358
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:43,671
The sunlight is heating the water.

359
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,923
Check out the humidity.

360
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,781
Yeah, and look at the CO2 levels.

361
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:49,302
Outside...

362
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,512
...it's completely toxic, and in here...

363
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,764
...there's nothing. lt's breathable.

364
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,435
What are you doing?

365
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,854
- Don't be an idiot.
- Don't be a skeptic.

366
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,496
There's something
generating an atmosphere.

367
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:04,109
David?

368
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:06,528
- Dr. Holloway is correct.
- Cleaner than Earth...

369
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:07,779
...actually.

370
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,096
They were terraforming.

371
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:10,656
Please don't do...

372
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,658
l'm not wearing this thing anymore.

373
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,410
Wish me luck, baby.

374
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:17,205
Do you copy?
Do not remove your headgear.

375
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,722
You crazy bastard.

376
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,729
Connect our suit cameras...

377
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:46,066
...if you want to continue watching this
freak show. We are taking our helmets off.

378
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,903
Copy that. Switching feeds.

379
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,073
Well, come on. Pay up.

380
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,494
- Pay what?
- What do you mean, "Pay what"?

381
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,164
Something is manufacturing
breathable air down there. That, mate...

382
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,167
- ...is terraforming.
- No, no. The bet was why we came here.

383
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,211
If you said a dead old man wanted
to talk to Martians, l'd pay.

384
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,670
Come on, a hundred credits.

385
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,841
Put it towards a lap dance with
Miss Vickers. How about that?

386
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,096
It's minus 12 in here.

387
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,389
So why is this water not frozen?

388
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,974
Maybe it ain't water.

389
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,184
Maybe it's Martian piss.

390
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:26,273
That's your scientific theory?

391
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,358
Is it? Mr. Biology?

392
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,520
Whatever it is, it sure is collagenous.

393
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,284
Some kind of sediment, perhaps.

394
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,430
Impressive.

395
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:18,992
What was that?

396
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,036
David?

397
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:22,787
David?

398
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,248
What is that?

399
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,168
David?

400
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,136
Ellie!

401
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:43,850
What was that?

402
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,603
I'm really glad we didn't bring weapons.

403
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,986
- Come on, El. Let's go.
- Whose idea was that?

404
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,314
Keep up!

405
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,608
Come on!

406
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,744
Where did he go?

407
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,626
Wait, wait, wait.

408
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,675
There it is. There it is. There it is.

409
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,178
Oh, my God, Charlie. We found them.

410
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,889
What do you mean "them"?

411
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,599
It is them, Ellie.

412
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,977
It looks like a door...

413
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,315
...and he's been decapitated by it.

414
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,068
Son of a bitch.

415
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,196
They were right.

416
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,784
What did you want them to be? Wrong?

417
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:48,706
David...

418
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,215
...please tell me you can read that.

419
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,002
Perhaps.

420
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,923
No, l'm out of here.

421
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,760
Hey, Fifield, where are you going?

422
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,513
What?

423
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,934
Look, l'm just a geologist.

424
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,269
I like rocks. l love rocks!

425
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,272
Now it's clear
you two don't give a shit about rocks.

426
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:16,005
But what you do seem to care about
is gigantic dead...

427
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:16,942
...bodies.

428
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,113
As l don't really have anything
to contribute in the gigantic...

429
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,614
...dead body arena...

430
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,661
...l want to go back to the ship,
if you don't mind.

431
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:30,956
Anyone wanna...

432
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,167
...join me, hey? You staying?

433
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,920
No, ship's good.

434
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,297
Yeah. Ship very good.

435
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:42,302
Congratulations on meeting your maker.

436
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,262
Thank you.

437
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,804
Pull yourself...

438
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:46,806
...together, man.

439
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:53,228
And l thought you were the crazy one.

440
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:02,904
Do you have the carbon reader?

441
00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:06,616
Thank you.

442
00:38:12,831 --> 00:38:14,031
How long's it been dead?

443
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,836
Two thousand years...

444
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:19,171
...give or take.

445
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,343
What are you doing, David?

446
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,012
I'm attempting to open the door.

447
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,472
Wait. We don't know
what's on the other side.

448
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,268
Oops. Sorry.

449
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:40,275
Look, Ford. lt's the head.

450
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,038
An amazing state of preservation.

451
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,082
- We'll take it in.
- Yeah.

452
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:00,712
Remarkably human.

453
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,065
Beautiful painting.

454
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,484
It's a mural.

455
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:35,748
Stop.

456
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,082
Stop. Don't touch it.

457
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,333
Sorry.

458
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,461
Please, don't touch anything.

459
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,254
Sweating.

460
00:40:22,043 --> 00:40:23,211
Organic.

461
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:30,802
Oh, no.

462
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:33,804
Charlie, the murals are changing.

463
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:36,421
I think we've affected the atmosphere
in the room.

464
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,434
Charlie, do you copy?

465
00:40:39,477 --> 00:40:40,311
Oh, the head!

466
00:40:40,603 --> 00:40:42,688
Ford, quick, help me bag the head!

467
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:55,827
- Boss.
- What you got?

468
00:40:56,828 --> 00:40:58,746
We got an incoming storm front.

469
00:40:58,913 --> 00:41:00,081
Silica...

470
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:02,250
...and lots of static. This is not good.

471
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,250
I see it.

472
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:08,089
Ground crew...

473
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:09,298
...this is Janek.

474
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:11,300
I need you to hustle back right now.

475
00:41:11,592 --> 00:41:13,093
Ground crew, do you copy me?

476
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:14,595
I got 200-kilometer...

477
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:16,347
...winds of airborne silica...

478
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:18,057
...and enough static to fry your suit.

479
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,642
Copy that, sir.

480
00:41:19,808 --> 00:41:20,768
We need more time.

481
00:41:21,477 --> 00:41:22,877
L'll be closing the outer...

482
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:24,188
...doors in 15 minutes.

483
00:41:24,355 --> 00:41:26,524
I sincerely hope you can make it.

484
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:31,196
Charlie! David!

485
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:32,864
We must leave now.

486
00:41:35,032 --> 00:41:36,700
This is just another tomb.

487
00:41:41,204 --> 00:41:42,415
David!

488
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,169
- On three.
- Two, three, up.

489
00:41:47,336 --> 00:41:48,712
Let's go!

490
00:41:49,464 --> 00:41:51,215
Easy, easy, easy. Careful.

491
00:41:54,301 --> 00:41:57,013
David, we are leaving!

492
00:42:06,563 --> 00:42:07,397
Come on!

493
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:09,314
Damn it, they've already taken off.

494
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:10,401
Come on, let's go.

495
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:15,197
Prometheus to ground crew.
You're running out of time.

496
00:42:15,406 --> 00:42:17,407
All right, come on. Let's go.

497
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:34,090
Go faster!

498
00:42:57,947 --> 00:42:59,073
Charlie! The head!

499
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:00,616
Ellie, no!

500
00:43:00,783 --> 00:43:01,733
What are you doing?

501
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:11,085
Hatch closure...

502
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:12,611
- ...in five seconds.
- Shit.

503
00:43:13,505 --> 00:43:14,355
Damn it, hold on!

504
00:43:16,634 --> 00:43:17,467
Goddamn it.

505
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:18,719
Door closing.

506
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:22,013
Ellie, don't move!

507
00:43:27,226 --> 00:43:28,059
Charlie!

508
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:32,482
Grab my hand!

509
00:43:43,661 --> 00:43:44,494
No!

510
00:43:45,204 --> 00:43:46,121
No, Ellie!

511
00:43:46,288 --> 00:43:47,121
Ellie!

512
00:44:25,368 --> 00:44:26,369
Got it.

513
00:44:34,335 --> 00:44:36,171
So, what was that, Ellie?

514
00:44:36,463 --> 00:44:38,965
You could've compromised the mission.
Not to mention...

515
00:44:39,048 --> 00:44:40,508
...almost killing yourself!

516
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:41,675
Are you all right?

517
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:43,427
Yes.

518
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:44,887
Thank you, David.

519
00:44:45,387 --> 00:44:46,888
My pleasure.

520
00:44:47,222 --> 00:44:49,015
Doctors, it's real good to have...

521
00:44:49,225 --> 00:44:51,519
...you back,
but where's Millburn and Fifield?

522
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:53,395
Aren't they back yet?

523
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:56,547
- Get them up for me.
- All right.

524
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,070
We've been here before, Fifield.

525
00:45:01,237 --> 00:45:03,907
I don't know. lt all looks the same to me.

526
00:45:04,866 --> 00:45:06,909
Boys, this is the captain. Listen up.

527
00:45:07,535 --> 00:45:10,246
Between the static electricity
and the wind speed...

528
00:45:10,412 --> 00:45:12,812
...well, there ain't no safe way
to come get you.

529
00:45:13,332 --> 00:45:14,165
What?

530
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:17,999
The temperature is dropping rapidly,
so get your helmets on and stay warm...

531
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,422
...until the storm passes.

532
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:21,423
Captain...

533
00:45:21,757 --> 00:45:25,107
...can you get a message to the scientist
and his zealot girlfriend?

534
00:45:26,095 --> 00:45:27,145
You got a pen nearby?

535
00:45:27,304 --> 00:45:29,223
No. No, l think we got it.

536
00:45:29,891 --> 00:45:31,726
Tell them l said... themselves.

537
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:33,810
Copy?

538
00:45:33,978 --> 00:45:36,272
Copy that.
All right, boys, keep your head down...

539
00:45:36,355 --> 00:45:38,649
...and we'll come get you in the morning.

540
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,401
Well, which way now?

541
00:45:41,568 --> 00:45:42,401
All right.

542
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,572
Well, which way, huh?

543
00:45:58,544 --> 00:46:00,546
Sample is sterile. No contagion present.

544
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:01,964
David.

545
00:46:05,259 --> 00:46:07,135
So are they all dead?

546
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:10,473
What? Who?

547
00:46:11,098 --> 00:46:12,308
Your Engineers.

548
00:46:12,808 --> 00:46:14,476
Are they all dead or aren't they?

549
00:46:14,685 --> 00:46:16,145
I don't know.

550
00:46:16,312 --> 00:46:17,605
We just got here.

551
00:46:18,064 --> 00:46:18,897
Scan.

552
00:46:21,483 --> 00:46:22,944
Do you care if they're dead?

553
00:46:23,862 --> 00:46:25,280
Weyland cared.

554
00:46:25,571 --> 00:46:27,156
Dr. Shaw.

555
00:46:27,448 --> 00:46:28,491
Have a look at this.

556
00:46:33,162 --> 00:46:35,122
- That's not an exoskeleton.
- No.

557
00:46:35,288 --> 00:46:37,291
I think it's a helmet.

558
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,919
- Let's see if we can lift it up.
- We should...

559
00:46:40,002 --> 00:46:41,502
...be able to prize this open.

560
00:46:42,212 --> 00:46:44,506
It's too heavy for us. David?

561
00:46:51,638 --> 00:46:52,848
Careful.

562
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,849
Like so.

563
00:47:08,696 --> 00:47:10,490
What is that on its head?

564
00:47:10,949 --> 00:47:13,076
It looks like new cells.

565
00:47:13,993 --> 00:47:15,995
- Ln a state of...
- Change.

566
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:16,996
Yes.

567
00:47:17,206 --> 00:47:18,540
Changing into what?

568
00:47:18,957 --> 00:47:21,357
Can you run a stem line
into the locus coeruleus?

569
00:47:21,543 --> 00:47:25,043
I think we can trick the nervous system
into thinking it's still alive.

570
00:47:26,422 --> 00:47:27,673
- Thirty amps.
- Okay.

571
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:29,133
No more.

572
00:47:30,677 --> 00:47:32,720
Let me make an incision.

573
00:47:33,471 --> 00:47:34,304
Okay.

574
00:47:39,811 --> 00:47:41,229
Go up, 40.

575
00:47:43,273 --> 00:47:44,358
Okay, 40 up.

576
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:47,069
Did you see that?

577
00:47:48,695 --> 00:47:50,488
- Yes.
- Yep. See?

578
00:47:50,655 --> 00:47:52,240
Go up another 10.

579
00:47:52,573 --> 00:47:54,033
Okay, up 10.

580
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:57,511
Maybe it's a little...

581
00:47:57,662 --> 00:47:59,456
- ...too much. Go down 10.
- Okay.

582
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:01,082
- Down 10.
- Down another 20.

583
00:48:01,624 --> 00:48:02,474
Okay, l'm trying.

584
00:48:03,418 --> 00:48:05,045
I'm trying, it's not going down.

585
00:48:05,212 --> 00:48:06,463
Full down. Ford...

586
00:48:06,713 --> 00:48:07,589
...stop it.

587
00:48:07,756 --> 00:48:09,007
Oh, God.

588
00:48:09,257 --> 00:48:11,343
David, contain it! Now!

589
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,719
Contain it? Turn it off!

590
00:48:13,095 --> 00:48:14,513
Oh, God. The smell!

591
00:48:15,388 --> 00:48:16,488
Oh, God, look at that.

592
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:17,599
Look at that.

593
00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:18,933
It's getting worse.

594
00:48:34,616 --> 00:48:36,410
Mortal, after all.

595
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:45,126
Ford, take a sample.

596
00:48:46,294 --> 00:48:47,920
Let's have a look.

597
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:54,969
No, sir, l will take care of it.

598
00:48:55,303 --> 00:48:57,680
Yes, sir, understood. l'm sorry.

599
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:01,308
Fortunately, slightly premature.

600
00:49:05,396 --> 00:49:06,814
Of course, sir.

601
00:49:35,259 --> 00:49:36,385
Miss Vickers.

602
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:42,140
What did he say, David?

603
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:44,810
I don't think he'd want me to tell you.

604
00:49:52,568 --> 00:49:54,862
What did he say?

605
00:49:55,029 --> 00:49:55,862
I'm sorry...

606
00:49:55,946 --> 00:49:57,115
...that's confidential.

607
00:49:57,282 --> 00:49:59,200
So help me God...

608
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:03,537
...l will find the cord that makes you run
and l will cut it.

609
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:06,415
What did he say?

610
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,209
He said:

611
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:12,713
"Try harder."

612
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:16,676
Cup of tea, ma'am?

613
00:50:33,275 --> 00:50:34,359
Genetic view.

614
00:50:34,526 --> 00:50:35,402
Okay.

615
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:37,988
Let's have a look at its DNA.

616
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:48,415
Isolate the strand.

617
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,210
Okay.

618
00:50:51,794 --> 00:50:53,921
Compare it to the gene sample?

619
00:50:54,255 --> 00:50:55,381
Yeah.

620
00:50:55,714 --> 00:50:56,757
Overlay.

621
00:50:57,091 --> 00:50:58,425
Processing.

622
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:01,720
Processing.

623
00:51:03,514 --> 00:51:05,891
DNA match.

624
00:51:07,184 --> 00:51:08,769
Oh, my God.

625
00:51:28,954 --> 00:51:30,248
It's us.

626
00:51:30,623 --> 00:51:31,791
It's everything.

627
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:37,714
What killed them?

628
00:51:55,272 --> 00:51:56,148
Big things...

629
00:51:56,315 --> 00:51:58,318
...have small beginnings.

630
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,162
Am l interrupting?

631
00:52:09,662 --> 00:52:11,957
I thought you might be running low.

632
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:18,952
- Pour yourself a glass, pal.
- Thank you, but l'm afraid...

633
00:52:19,088 --> 00:52:20,506
...it would be wasted on me.

634
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,343
Right, l almost forgot
you're not a real boy.

635
00:52:27,388 --> 00:52:29,849
I'm very sorry that your Engineers
are all gone.

636
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,237
You think we wasted our time
coming here, don't you?

637
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:43,196
Your question depends on me understanding
what you hoped to achieve by coming here.

638
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:46,199
What we hoped to achieve
was to meet our makers.

639
00:52:46,365 --> 00:52:47,283
To get answers.

640
00:52:47,908 --> 00:52:49,743
Why they even...

641
00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:51,371
...made us in the first place.

642
00:52:53,956 --> 00:52:56,334
Why do you think your people made me?

643
00:52:57,627 --> 00:52:58,795
Because we could.

644
00:53:01,714 --> 00:53:04,092
Can you imagine how disappointing
it would be...

645
00:53:04,259 --> 00:53:06,409
...to hear the same thing
from your creator?

646
00:53:11,724 --> 00:53:12,557
I guess it's...

647
00:53:12,683 --> 00:53:14,393
...good you can't be disappointed.

648
00:53:14,977 --> 00:53:16,478
Yes. lt's wonderful...

649
00:53:17,147 --> 00:53:17,814
...actually.

650
00:53:17,981 --> 00:53:19,732
May l ask you something?

651
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:21,984
Please do.

652
00:53:22,151 --> 00:53:23,402
How far would you go...

653
00:53:24,153 --> 00:53:26,780
...to get what you came all this way for?

654
00:53:26,947 --> 00:53:28,323
Your answers.

655
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:30,924
What are you willing to do?

656
00:53:31,244 --> 00:53:32,703
Anything and everything.

657
00:53:33,996 --> 00:53:36,248
That's worth drinking to, l'd imagine.

658
00:53:47,676 --> 00:53:49,553
Here's mud in your eye, pal.

659
00:53:53,974 --> 00:53:55,350
Good health.

660
00:54:00,231 --> 00:54:01,482
It's those things.

661
00:54:05,152 --> 00:54:06,278
Are they real?

662
00:54:08,154 --> 00:54:09,304
Of course they're real.

663
00:54:10,366 --> 00:54:12,076
Jesus Christ. l mean...

664
00:54:13,368 --> 00:54:14,536
Look at the pile.

665
00:54:15,203 --> 00:54:17,081
Look how high up they are.

666
00:54:17,998 --> 00:54:18,831
It looks like...

667
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:23,128
- ...they were running from something.
- Okay. Don't touch, okay?

668
00:54:23,713 --> 00:54:27,925
Man, this thing is opened up
from the inside.

669
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:29,635
Almost like it exploded.

670
00:54:30,636 --> 00:54:34,639
Looks like a scene out some sort
of holocaust painting, you know?

671
00:54:47,861 --> 00:54:49,071
Well...

672
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,871
So, whatever killed them
is long gone, right?

673
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,122
Millburn, Fifield.

674
00:54:59,289 --> 00:55:00,457
This is Prometheus.

675
00:55:00,624 --> 00:55:01,833
What is your position?

676
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,461
Prometheus, this is Millburn.

677
00:55:04,753 --> 00:55:06,672
We are at 7-4-0...

678
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:09,049
...1-4-7-7. Why?

679
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:12,803
Just got a ping
about one click west of you.

680
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,555
What do you mean "a ping"?

681
00:55:15,013 --> 00:55:16,682
Well, whatever...

682
00:55:16,848 --> 00:55:18,851
...that probe is picking up...

683
00:55:19,018 --> 00:55:20,186
...it's not dead.

684
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:22,021
It's reading a life form.

685
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:24,690
- What?
- Okay, what do you mean, "a life form"?

686
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,775
Is it...? ls it moving?

687
00:55:27,567 --> 00:55:29,486
No, l don't think so.

688
00:55:29,778 --> 00:55:31,113
Captain, you're...

689
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,823
...obviously not seeing...

690
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:34,366
...what we're seeing here.

691
00:55:34,533 --> 00:55:36,869
If you were,
you wouldn't be talking about a ping.

692
00:55:36,952 --> 00:55:38,244
I know, boys.

693
00:55:38,578 --> 00:55:41,831
Your signal has been coming in
sporadically since the storm hit.

694
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,590
That's no good to us down here!

695
00:55:46,086 --> 00:55:50,006
Is it...? ls it moving?
Are these things moving?

696
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:55,803
No. No, itjust disappeared, actually.

697
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:57,472
Must be a glitch.

698
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:00,099
What do you mean, "a glitch"?

699
00:56:00,308 --> 00:56:01,225
All right, boys.

700
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:03,519
Sleep tight.

701
00:56:04,396 --> 00:56:05,897
Try not to bugger each other.

702
00:56:06,064 --> 00:56:08,066
Captain, what do you mean, "a glitch"?

703
00:56:08,691 --> 00:56:11,236
Millburn, what does he mean? Wait.

704
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,280
Now, he said...

705
00:56:14,364 --> 00:56:17,075
- He said one click west, yeah?
- Yeah.

706
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:19,201
Now, we...

707
00:56:19,368 --> 00:56:21,318
We don't want to check that out, do we?

708
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:22,413
Shit, no.

709
00:56:22,663 --> 00:56:23,915
Where are we gonna go?

710
00:56:24,082 --> 00:56:25,083
East.

711
00:56:26,709 --> 00:56:27,960
Yeah, east.

712
00:56:28,127 --> 00:56:32,215
A fucking glitch, man. "Pings,
glitch, life form." What the fuck?

713
00:56:32,465 --> 00:56:36,677
Based on the behavior of the subject
in these holographic recordings...

714
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:39,586
...we're attempting to identify
what caused the head...

715
00:56:39,723 --> 00:56:41,891
...to combust. l can't help but wonder...

716
00:56:42,475 --> 00:56:44,894
...was there an outbreak here?

717
00:56:49,648 --> 00:56:50,608
You rang...

718
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:52,902
- ...ma'am?
- L have something important...

719
00:56:53,152 --> 00:56:54,946
...to tell you. What is that?

720
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,407
This is...

721
00:56:57,574 --> 00:56:59,951
...a rose that l had frozen
with the champagne.

722
00:57:00,118 --> 00:57:03,204
I was gonna give it to you
when we found what we came for.

723
00:57:04,498 --> 00:57:06,333
We did find what we came for.

724
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:07,960
They were here. This is...

725
00:57:08,043 --> 00:57:12,630
The most significant discovery
in the history...

726
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:14,965
...of mankind. Oh, l know.

727
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:19,637
It's incredible, it really is.

728
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:23,599
But l wanted to talk to them.

729
00:57:23,975 --> 00:57:26,811
I mean, don't you want to know
why they came?

730
00:57:28,187 --> 00:57:29,772
Why they abandoned us?

731
00:57:30,148 --> 00:57:31,983
I just want answers, baby.

732
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,610
We were right, Charlie.

733
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:36,154
I have proof.

734
00:57:38,156 --> 00:57:39,073
Look.

735
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:48,166
Their genetic material predates ours.

736
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:49,834
We come from them.

737
00:57:51,293 --> 00:57:52,961
- You're kidding me.
- No.

738
00:57:55,964 --> 00:57:57,132
Okay.

739
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:58,843
Okay.

740
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:04,014
Okay. l guess you can take
your father's cross off now.

741
00:58:04,765 --> 00:58:07,017
Why would l want to do that?

742
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,269
Because they made us.

743
00:58:09,477 --> 00:58:10,729
And who made them?

744
00:58:11,647 --> 00:58:13,690
Well, exactly. We'll never know.

745
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,942
But here's what we do know:

746
00:58:16,109 --> 00:58:19,947
That there is nothing special
about the creation of life.

747
00:58:20,114 --> 00:58:21,531
Right? Anybody can do it.

748
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,744
All you need is a dash of DNA
and half a brain, right?

749
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:28,914
I can't.

750
00:58:30,499 --> 00:58:32,709
I can't create life.

751
00:58:34,586 --> 00:58:37,255
What does that say about me?

752
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:41,551
Ellie, that's not... l didn't mean...

753
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,261
l wasn't talking about...

754
00:58:43,428 --> 00:58:45,097
Children?

755
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:46,432
Us.

756
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:51,145
Hey, hey, hey.

757
00:58:51,312 --> 00:58:52,688
Hey.

758
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:54,773
Hey.

759
00:58:55,607 --> 00:58:57,484
Elizabeth Shaw...

760
00:58:57,651 --> 00:59:01,154
...you are the most special person
l have ever met in my life...

761
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:03,156
...and l love you.

762
00:59:07,202 --> 00:59:08,453
Hey.

763
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,090
How much longer will this take?

764
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:58,545
I don't know.

765
00:59:58,712 --> 01:00:00,213
I'm just a captain.

766
01:00:09,347 --> 01:00:11,808
That thing sounds like a dying cat,
by the way.

767
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:15,812
L'll have you know that this thing...

768
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:18,189
...once belonged to Stephen Stills.

769
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,191
Am l supposed to know who that is?

770
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,657
You know...

771
01:00:28,532 --> 01:00:29,909
...if you wanna get laid...

772
01:00:30,075 --> 01:00:31,975
...you really don't have to pretend...

773
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,247
...to be interested in the pyramid scan.

774
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:38,835
You could just say,
"Hey, l'm trying to get laid."

775
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:41,212
l could. l could say that, right?

776
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,339
But it wouldn't make sense...

777
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:47,676
...why l would fly myself half a
billion miles from every man on Earth...

778
01:00:47,843 --> 01:00:49,845
...if l wanted to get laid, would it?

779
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:53,516
Hey, Vickers.

780
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,518
Hey, Vickers.

781
01:00:56,685 --> 01:00:58,521
I was wondering...

782
01:01:02,775 --> 01:01:04,193
Are you a robot?

783
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:13,911
My room.

784
01:01:15,037 --> 01:01:15,871
Ten minutes.

785
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:24,046
Well, if you can't be
with the one you love

786
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,173
Love the one

787
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,466
You're with

788
01:01:26,674 --> 01:01:28,092
Love the one you're with

789
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,225
Millburn.

790
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:38,394
What's all this black stuff?

791
01:01:42,856 --> 01:01:43,816
Gazpacho.

792
01:01:46,444 --> 01:01:47,403
Is that tobacco?

793
01:01:48,279 --> 01:01:49,196
Is that tobacco...

794
01:01:49,363 --> 01:01:50,489
...in your respirator?

795
01:01:50,656 --> 01:01:52,242
Yeah, sure.

796
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,248
Tobacco.

797
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:02,615
On behalf of scientists everywhere,
l am ashamed to count you amongst us...

798
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,337
...Fifield. Really.

799
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:09,741
- Hey, Millburn.
- Yeah?

800
01:02:09,883 --> 01:02:10,833
You see this thing?

801
01:02:10,926 --> 01:02:14,263
What do you think this thing was?
Some kind of a god?

802
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,724
Something they worshiped? What?

803
01:02:16,974 --> 01:02:18,974
- Lt kind of looks like...
- What's that?

804
01:02:19,393 --> 01:02:20,493
What the hell is that?

805
01:02:20,602 --> 01:02:21,853
Oh, my God. Okay.

806
01:02:22,062 --> 01:02:23,412
Just stay calm. Stay quiet.

807
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:25,774
This is okay, l can handle this.

808
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:27,443
Hey, baby.

809
01:02:28,235 --> 01:02:29,068
Hey.

810
01:02:29,945 --> 01:02:31,154
Come in, Prometheus.

811
01:02:31,446 --> 01:02:35,033
We have an elongate reptile-type creature.

812
01:02:35,283 --> 01:02:39,371
Maybe 30, 40 inches,
with transparent skin.

813
01:02:39,788 --> 01:02:41,122
And it's beautiful.

814
01:02:42,624 --> 01:02:43,457
Okay!

815
01:02:46,712 --> 01:02:47,379
Prometheus...

816
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:48,379
...we have two.

817
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:50,966
Look at you. Look at you, baby.

818
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,927
Jesus, look at the size of that.
What is it?

819
01:02:54,094 --> 01:02:56,722
- You need to stay calm.
- What's there to be calm about?

820
01:02:56,805 --> 01:02:59,224
You need to stay calm
because she is beautiful.

821
01:02:59,391 --> 01:03:01,142
What makes you think that's female?

822
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:02,560
She's a lady. Look!

823
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:09,651
Hey.

824
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:11,570
She's mesmerized.

825
01:03:11,987 --> 01:03:14,114
Come here. Come here.

826
01:03:16,366 --> 01:03:17,492
It's okay.

827
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:19,328
It's okay. lt's okay.

828
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:21,330
Hey, baby.

829
01:03:24,499 --> 01:03:25,417
You're strong!

830
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:26,793
You should...

831
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,627
...help me now.

832
01:03:27,794 --> 01:03:28,627
Get it off.

833
01:03:31,047 --> 01:03:31,924
Cut it here, man!

834
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,190
I ain't touching that!

835
01:03:34,176 --> 01:03:36,177
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

836
01:03:36,386 --> 01:03:38,472
- Lt's getting tighter.
- L ain't touching it!

837
01:03:38,555 --> 01:03:41,308
Cut the thing, man, for God's sake!

838
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:43,393
God, you're making it worse!

839
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:45,396
It's tightening! lt's tight...

840
01:03:45,813 --> 01:03:47,022
lt's breaking my arm!

841
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:49,690
Shit!

842
01:03:49,942 --> 01:03:50,817
Cut it off!

843
01:03:50,984 --> 01:03:52,694
Cut it off!

844
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:53,695
Cut it off!

845
01:03:53,862 --> 01:03:54,695
Cut it off!

846
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:58,117
Shit!

847
01:03:58,283 --> 01:03:59,116
Oh, my God!

848
01:04:00,327 --> 01:04:02,370
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

849
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,040
It's in my suit.

850
01:04:05,207 --> 01:04:06,040
Jesus Christ.

851
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:07,894
Shaw, you up?

852
01:05:09,604 --> 01:05:10,771
Yeah, what's up?

853
01:05:11,147 --> 01:05:13,441
The storm passed,
but l can't reach Millburn...

854
01:05:13,524 --> 01:05:16,774
...or Fifield. Taking a few men down,
see if l can rustle them up.

855
01:05:16,902 --> 01:05:17,986
Okay.

856
01:05:18,946 --> 01:05:20,531
Any idea where they are?

857
01:05:20,698 --> 01:05:24,368
Last time they radioed in
was where you found your head.

858
01:05:24,911 --> 01:05:26,871
Okay, we're coming.

859
01:05:27,038 --> 01:05:27,871
All right.

860
01:05:27,955 --> 01:05:30,791
Chance, you're coming with me. Come on.

861
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:31,960
All right, boss.

862
01:05:33,795 --> 01:05:36,589
- Ravel, did you fix that glitch?
- No, captain.

863
01:05:36,756 --> 01:05:39,550
- Lt's gotta be in the hardware.
- What glitch, captain?

864
01:05:39,675 --> 01:05:42,219
One of them probes picked up a life form.

865
01:05:42,928 --> 01:05:43,971
Pops up every hour...

866
01:05:44,054 --> 01:05:46,974
...for a couple of seconds
and then it's gone.

867
01:05:47,141 --> 01:05:48,741
I can find the probe and fix it.

868
01:05:48,893 --> 01:05:50,477
Knock yourself out.

869
01:05:51,855 --> 01:05:53,314
Be careful, doctors.

870
01:06:14,543 --> 01:06:16,295
Fifield!

871
01:06:19,048 --> 01:06:20,216
Millburn?

872
01:06:24,512 --> 01:06:25,889
All right, come on down.

873
01:06:46,908 --> 01:06:49,869
David, are you alone?

874
01:06:50,995 --> 01:06:52,122
Yes, Miss Vickers.

875
01:06:52,289 --> 01:06:54,458
Uplink your feed to my room.

876
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:55,917
Copy.

877
01:08:38,521 --> 01:08:40,731
You son of a bitch.

878
01:08:42,858 --> 01:08:44,526
You cut me off.

879
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:07,173
What is this?

880
01:09:10,676 --> 01:09:12,026
- Charlie?
- L just tripped.

881
01:09:12,178 --> 01:09:13,378
Oh, my God, you're sick!

882
01:09:13,512 --> 01:09:15,430
I'm okay, baby. Come on.

883
01:09:15,597 --> 01:09:16,640
Fifield?

884
01:09:17,516 --> 01:09:18,684
Millburn?

885
01:09:25,148 --> 01:09:26,748
Hey, Chance. l wouldn't touch...

886
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:28,027
...that if l were you.

887
01:09:30,904 --> 01:09:32,240
Dr. Shaw?

888
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:33,533
Yeah?

889
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:35,660
Do we have any idea what is...

890
01:09:35,868 --> 01:09:37,318
...oozing out of these vases?

891
01:09:37,453 --> 01:09:40,622
No. They weren't like this
last time we were here.

892
01:09:45,336 --> 01:09:46,462
Captain?

893
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:47,922
What?

894
01:09:48,172 --> 01:09:49,215
Who is it? Which one?

895
01:09:49,298 --> 01:09:51,133
- Who is it?
- Lt's Millburn.

896
01:09:51,675 --> 01:09:53,553
- Ellie.
- Don't touch him. Hold on.

897
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:54,553
Ellie, honey.

898
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,555
Charlie, what's wrong?

899
01:09:56,722 --> 01:09:59,267
I need you to look at me, okay?

900
01:09:59,434 --> 01:10:00,560
You know infections...

901
01:10:00,727 --> 01:10:01,853
...so, what do you see?

902
01:10:01,936 --> 01:10:03,562
This is not good, baby.

903
01:10:03,729 --> 01:10:05,779
You look at me, you tell me what you see.

904
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:10,777
Oh, my God.

905
01:10:11,236 --> 01:10:12,822
Ford, get over here.

906
01:10:12,989 --> 01:10:14,573
It's okay. Janek?

907
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,367
- What?
- We have to go now!

908
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,242
What do you see?

909
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:19,412
Honey, what do you see?

910
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,664
Holloway's sick. He's not good.

911
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:22,415
I see movement...

912
01:10:22,623 --> 01:10:23,623
...in his esophagus.

913
01:10:27,587 --> 01:10:29,255
- Come on, baby.
- No. l'm okay.

914
01:10:29,422 --> 01:10:30,381
Janek!

915
01:10:30,548 --> 01:10:31,716
Come over and help me!

916
01:10:31,924 --> 01:10:34,343
- L'm okay.
- Ford, get over there. What's happening?

917
01:10:34,426 --> 01:10:35,511
- L'm okay.
- Let's go!

918
01:10:35,594 --> 01:10:36,678
Help me with him.

919
01:10:36,928 --> 01:10:39,765
I got you.
We're gonna get you out of here.

920
01:10:39,974 --> 01:10:40,599
Prometheus...

921
01:10:40,766 --> 01:10:41,433
...come in.

922
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,519
- Watch your head.
- Okay. l'm okay.

923
01:10:43,685 --> 01:10:45,438
- Holloway.
- Get him up.

924
01:10:45,605 --> 01:10:47,440
- Come on.
- Prometheus, come in.

925
01:10:47,607 --> 01:10:48,774
Is anyone there?

926
01:10:49,442 --> 01:10:50,693
This is Vickers.

927
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,321
I need a medical team
standing by the airlock.

928
01:10:53,655 --> 01:10:55,698
Full quarantine fail-safe.

929
01:10:55,865 --> 01:10:57,325
Holloway's sick.

930
01:10:57,491 --> 01:10:58,743
Sick with what?

931
01:10:58,909 --> 01:11:01,120
- Just do it.
- Let's get him back to the ship.

932
01:11:01,203 --> 01:11:03,247
- Lt's not safe down here.
- Charlie?

933
01:11:03,455 --> 01:11:04,289
I'm suiting up.

934
01:11:04,456 --> 01:11:06,125
- Charlie, talk to me.
- Move!

935
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:08,627
- What was that back there?
- Let's go, people!

936
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:12,506
We've gotta move!
We've gotta move!

937
01:11:12,673 --> 01:11:13,548
Ellie!

938
01:15:11,034 --> 01:15:12,244
He don't look too good.

939
01:15:12,452 --> 01:15:15,248
Did he catch something down there?
We had our helmets off.

940
01:15:15,331 --> 01:15:16,164
I don't know.

941
01:15:16,332 --> 01:15:19,335
Prometheus, this is Janek.
Make sure that back door is open.

942
01:15:19,711 --> 01:15:20,795
Aye, captain.

943
01:15:21,004 --> 01:15:23,339
Oh, God. l'm so sorry.

944
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,300
Come on!

945
01:15:26,467 --> 01:15:28,177
Please!

946
01:15:33,015 --> 01:15:35,517
Prometheus! Why is that door not open?

947
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,895
Vickers, that is an order!

948
01:15:38,687 --> 01:15:40,355
Get that goddamn door open!

949
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,108
- Look at me. lt's too late, l'm sick.
- No, it's not.

950
01:15:43,191 --> 01:15:44,400
Come on!

951
01:15:45,109 --> 01:15:45,942
Ford, help me!

952
01:15:46,195 --> 01:15:48,322
Airlock crew, if you can hear me,
it's Janek.

953
01:15:48,405 --> 01:15:50,031
Open that back door right now!

954
01:15:50,198 --> 01:15:51,366
Hold that door!

955
01:15:51,574 --> 01:15:52,200
Prometheus...

956
01:15:52,367 --> 01:15:53,200
...do you copy?

957
01:15:53,284 --> 01:15:55,786
Goddamn it, open that door!
That is an order!

958
01:15:55,953 --> 01:15:57,038
Open it.

959
01:16:04,086 --> 01:16:05,379
What the hell is this?

960
01:16:05,546 --> 01:16:07,090
He's not coming onboard.

961
01:16:07,257 --> 01:16:08,717
Vickers, this is a sick man.

962
01:16:08,925 --> 01:16:10,135
I see that. That's why...

963
01:16:10,218 --> 01:16:11,318
...he's not coming on!

964
01:16:12,053 --> 01:16:13,055
Charlie!

965
01:16:13,222 --> 01:16:14,322
Chance, get over here!

966
01:16:17,559 --> 01:16:18,268
Please!

967
01:16:18,435 --> 01:16:19,535
We can still help him!

968
01:16:21,187 --> 01:16:23,856
Help yourself.
Everybody but Holloway back on this ship!

969
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:25,524
I won't leave him!

970
01:16:25,691 --> 01:16:26,526
Then stay!

971
01:16:26,693 --> 01:16:27,861
Wait! We could...

972
01:16:28,027 --> 01:16:29,737
...put him on the Med-Pod!

973
01:16:29,904 --> 01:16:30,954
Please don't do this.

974
01:16:31,113 --> 01:16:32,448
It's okay, Ellie.

975
01:16:32,615 --> 01:16:33,617
Vickers!

976
01:16:33,783 --> 01:16:34,784
What are you doing?

977
01:16:35,076 --> 01:16:36,244
I love you, baby.

978
01:16:36,411 --> 01:16:37,311
- L love you.
- No.

979
01:16:37,453 --> 01:16:38,788
I'm telling you, stay back!

980
01:16:38,871 --> 01:16:39,581
Do it.

981
01:16:39,748 --> 01:16:40,624
Stay back!

982
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:41,875
No! No, Charlie!

983
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:42,875
- Do it.
- No!

984
01:16:48,381 --> 01:16:49,590
No!

985
01:16:51,675 --> 01:16:53,136
No!

986
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:55,138
No!

987
01:16:58,808 --> 01:16:59,893
Charlie!

988
01:17:02,645 --> 01:17:04,272
No!

989
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:19,621
My deepest condolences.

990
01:17:20,955 --> 01:17:22,749
I'm going to have to take this.

991
01:17:22,915 --> 01:17:24,459
It may be contaminated.

992
01:17:25,585 --> 01:17:29,631
If there's a contagion,
we were all exposed.

993
01:17:31,216 --> 01:17:35,066
You need... We need to run blood work
on everyone who set foot in the pyramid.

994
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,055
Yes, of course.

995
01:17:37,347 --> 01:17:38,640
Yes?

996
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:48,358
I understand how...

997
01:17:48,525 --> 01:17:50,026
...inappropriate this is...

998
01:17:50,818 --> 01:17:53,154
...given the circumstances.

999
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,323
But as you ordered
quarantine fail-safes...

1000
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:00,453
...it's my responsibility to ask.

1001
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:05,541
Have you and Dr. Holloway
had any intimate contact recently?

1002
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,075
Since you and he were...

1003
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:09,461
...so close...

1004
01:18:10,378 --> 01:18:11,278
...l want to be...

1005
01:18:11,379 --> 01:18:12,840
...as thorough as poss...

1006
01:18:14,842 --> 01:18:15,676
My, my.

1007
01:18:19,889 --> 01:18:20,765
You're pregnant.

1008
01:18:23,642 --> 01:18:24,475
What?

1009
01:18:25,811 --> 01:18:27,661
From the look of it, three months so.

1010
01:18:28,022 --> 01:18:31,108
No, that's impossible.

1011
01:18:31,442 --> 01:18:33,527
I can't be pregnant.

1012
01:18:33,819 --> 01:18:37,155
Did you have intercourse
with Dr. Holloway?

1013
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:39,199
Yes...

1014
01:18:39,365 --> 01:18:42,411
...but 10 hours ago.

1015
01:18:42,744 --> 01:18:46,249
There's no bloody way
l'm three months pregnant.

1016
01:18:46,415 --> 01:18:47,249
Well, doctor...

1017
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:50,335
...it's not exactly a traditional fetus.

1018
01:18:54,048 --> 01:18:54,924
I want to see it.

1019
01:18:55,216 --> 01:18:56,926
Don't think that's a good idea.

1020
01:18:58,761 --> 01:19:01,596
David, l want to see it.

1021
01:19:01,888 --> 01:19:03,098
Now, doctor...

1022
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,102
l want to see it.

1023
01:19:08,187 --> 01:19:09,605
I want it out of me.

1024
01:19:09,855 --> 01:19:11,440
We don't have the personnel...

1025
01:19:11,606 --> 01:19:14,068
...to perform a procedure like that.

1026
01:19:14,276 --> 01:19:16,076
- Our best option...
- l want it out.

1027
01:19:16,278 --> 01:19:17,279
Put you back into...

1028
01:19:17,446 --> 01:19:19,396
...cryostasis until we return to Earth.

1029
01:19:19,531 --> 01:19:21,826
Please, get it out of me.

1030
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:23,577
Get it out of me!

1031
01:19:23,869 --> 01:19:24,954
Please.

1032
01:19:28,623 --> 01:19:30,292
It must be very painful.

1033
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:33,295
Here, let me give you something.

1034
01:19:37,299 --> 01:19:38,967
That's it. There, there.

1035
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:47,977
Someone will be along shortly...

1036
01:19:48,269 --> 01:19:50,646
...to bring you back to Cryo Deck.

1037
01:19:54,983 --> 01:19:57,194
It must feel like your God abandoned you.

1038
01:19:57,819 --> 01:19:58,987
What?

1039
01:19:59,154 --> 01:19:59,987
To lose...

1040
01:20:00,114 --> 01:20:04,826
...Dr. Holloway after your father died
under such similar circumstances.

1041
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:07,495
What was it that killed him?

1042
01:20:08,246 --> 01:20:09,706
Ebola?

1043
01:20:14,086 --> 01:20:16,838
How do you...? How do you know that?

1044
01:20:17,964 --> 01:20:19,757
I watched your dreams.

1045
01:20:42,322 --> 01:20:43,406
Dr. Shaw?

1046
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:45,899
We're here to put you...

1047
01:20:46,034 --> 01:20:49,412
...in an anti-contamination suit,
take you back to Cryo Deck...

1048
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,205
...go to beddy-byes.

1049
01:20:51,914 --> 01:20:53,374
Dr. Shaw?

1050
01:20:54,876 --> 01:20:56,335
She's doped. Prepare her.

1051
01:21:26,365 --> 01:21:30,620
Emergency procedures initiated. Please
verbally state the nature of your injury.

1052
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:33,206
I need a Caesarean.

1053
01:21:33,749 --> 01:21:35,999
Error. This Med-Pod
is calibrated for male...

1054
01:21:36,084 --> 01:21:37,734
...patients and does not offer...

1055
01:21:37,836 --> 01:21:40,839
...the procedure you have requested.
Seek medical assistance...

1056
01:21:40,922 --> 01:21:41,923
...elsewhere.

1057
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,133
Surgery.

1058
01:21:45,384 --> 01:21:46,761
Abdominal.

1059
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:48,303
Penetrating...

1060
01:21:48,388 --> 01:21:49,722
...injuries.

1061
01:21:50,056 --> 01:21:51,641
Foreign body.

1062
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:53,017
Initiate.

1063
01:21:55,687 --> 01:21:57,563
Surgical procedure to begin.

1064
01:22:39,062 --> 01:22:40,105
Running diagnostics.

1065
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:44,985
Oh, come on.

1066
01:22:46,569 --> 01:22:48,822
Get it out! Come on!

1067
01:22:49,239 --> 01:22:50,072
Please!

1068
01:22:53,285 --> 01:22:54,620
Oh, God!

1069
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:58,665
- Come on!
- Lnitiating anesthetics.

1070
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:00,666
Please!

1071
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:08,967
Commence surgical procedure.

1072
01:23:49,925 --> 01:23:50,884
Oh, God.

1073
01:23:54,513 --> 01:23:55,222
Oh, God!

1074
01:23:55,347 --> 01:23:56,723
Oh, God!

1075
01:24:15,242 --> 01:24:16,911
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1076
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:18,370
Oh, my God!

1077
01:24:35,178 --> 01:24:36,346
Come on!

1078
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:03,247
Bridge...

1079
01:25:03,456 --> 01:25:05,083
...to hangar. This is the captain.

1080
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:07,166
- Yes, captain.
- Can you see what l see?

1081
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,379
Fifield's monitorjust popped up.

1082
01:25:09,796 --> 01:25:11,631
What? Where?

1083
01:25:11,798 --> 01:25:14,217
According to what l'm looking at,
it's outside...

1084
01:25:14,383 --> 01:25:15,551
...the goddamn ship.

1085
01:25:15,968 --> 01:25:17,136
Barnes, open the door!

1086
01:25:17,303 --> 01:25:19,304
Fifield, do you copy me? Come on in.

1087
01:25:20,222 --> 01:25:21,055
Fifield?

1088
01:25:33,235 --> 01:25:34,488
Wait a second.

1089
01:25:43,662 --> 01:25:44,580
Hey, Wallace.

1090
01:25:44,747 --> 01:25:45,998
Take a look at this.

1091
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:52,503
Fifield?

1092
01:25:55,175 --> 01:25:57,135
What the hell is going on down there?

1093
01:26:11,023 --> 01:26:12,149
I'm coming down there.

1094
01:26:12,316 --> 01:26:13,616
Chance, you're suiting up.

1095
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:15,585
- Come on.
- Don't let it on the ship!

1096
01:26:30,502 --> 01:26:31,335
Take him out!

1097
01:26:31,836 --> 01:26:32,669
Got him!

1098
01:26:34,714 --> 01:26:35,547
Do it!

1099
01:26:39,218 --> 01:26:41,346
- You ready, Chance?
- Yes.

1100
01:26:44,348 --> 01:26:45,182
Come on!

1101
01:26:45,391 --> 01:26:46,559
Get in the rover!

1102
01:26:47,476 --> 01:26:48,727
We gotta get out of here!

1103
01:26:55,901 --> 01:26:56,735
Go!

1104
01:27:28,266 --> 01:27:29,559
What is that?

1105
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:07,138
You've been asleep.

1106
01:28:07,306 --> 01:28:09,975
You were on the ship all this time. Why?

1107
01:28:11,435 --> 01:28:12,894
Well, l...

1108
01:28:13,061 --> 01:28:14,939
l have a few days of life left in me.

1109
01:28:16,148 --> 01:28:17,525
I didn't wanna waste them...

1110
01:28:17,608 --> 01:28:19,818
...until you could deliver
what you promised.

1111
01:28:21,027 --> 01:28:22,571
To meet my maker.

1112
01:28:22,737 --> 01:28:23,947
There we are, sir.

1113
01:28:24,155 --> 01:28:27,326
- Nice and clean.
- Haven't you told him they're all gone?

1114
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:32,080
But they're not all gone, Dr. Shaw.

1115
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:33,999
One of them is still alive.

1116
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,627
We're on our way to see him now.

1117
01:28:36,919 --> 01:28:38,003
What?

1118
01:28:38,378 --> 01:28:39,671
Turn me around.

1119
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:45,177
You convinced me that...

1120
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,889
...if these things made us...

1121
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:52,684
...then surely they could save us.

1122
01:28:53,351 --> 01:28:54,311
My stick, please.

1123
01:28:59,024 --> 01:29:01,234
Well, save me, anyway.

1124
01:29:01,734 --> 01:29:03,736
Save you from what?

1125
01:29:04,362 --> 01:29:05,821
Death, of course.

1126
01:29:06,113 --> 01:29:07,197
Stand me up.

1127
01:29:11,661 --> 01:29:12,662
I'm all right.

1128
01:29:13,496 --> 01:29:14,663
I'm all right.

1129
01:29:15,664 --> 01:29:16,832
Yes, sir.

1130
01:29:17,082 --> 01:29:18,332
But you don't understand.

1131
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:20,377
You don't know.

1132
01:29:20,544 --> 01:29:23,339
This place isn't what we thought it was.
They aren't...

1133
01:29:23,506 --> 01:29:25,549
...what we thought they were.

1134
01:29:25,716 --> 01:29:26,884
I was wrong.

1135
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,303
We were so wrong.

1136
01:29:28,845 --> 01:29:30,263
Charlie...

1137
01:29:30,888 --> 01:29:33,057
Dr. Holloway's dead.

1138
01:29:34,392 --> 01:29:36,394
We must leave!

1139
01:29:36,895 --> 01:29:38,855
And what would Charlie do...

1140
01:29:39,147 --> 01:29:44,026
...now that we're so close...

1141
01:29:44,318 --> 01:29:47,697
...to answering
the most meaningful questions...

1142
01:29:47,864 --> 01:29:49,407
...ever asked by mankind?

1143
01:29:50,783 --> 01:29:52,493
How can you leave without...

1144
01:29:52,701 --> 01:29:54,662
...knowing what they are?

1145
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:03,713
Or have you lost your faith, Shaw?

1146
01:30:39,831 --> 01:30:42,585
Okay. Okay.

1147
01:31:01,937 --> 01:31:03,314
Come in.

1148
01:31:10,488 --> 01:31:12,489
Where the hell are you going, doc?

1149
01:31:12,823 --> 01:31:14,825
You know what this place is?

1150
01:31:15,242 --> 01:31:18,954
Those Engineers? This ain't their home.

1151
01:31:20,371 --> 01:31:22,791
It's an installation.
Maybe even military.

1152
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:26,128
They put it out here
because they're not stupid enough...

1153
01:31:26,211 --> 01:31:29,464
...to make weapons of mass destruction
on their own doorstep.

1154
01:31:30,131 --> 01:31:33,676
That's what all that shit is
in those vases.

1155
01:31:34,093 --> 01:31:35,262
They made it here.

1156
01:31:35,512 --> 01:31:39,557
It got out, it turned on them. The end.

1157
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,645
It's time for us to go home.

1158
01:31:44,187 --> 01:31:46,022
One of them is still alive.

1159
01:31:50,611 --> 01:31:53,155
Don't you want to know
what they have to say?

1160
01:31:56,616 --> 01:31:58,284
I don't care.

1161
01:32:00,203 --> 01:32:01,330
Right.

1162
01:32:02,122 --> 01:32:04,040
All you do is fly the ship.

1163
01:32:04,374 --> 01:32:05,542
That's right.

1164
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:09,338
But you must care
about something, captain.

1165
01:32:11,673 --> 01:32:14,426
If you didn't, why are you here?

1166
01:32:17,387 --> 01:32:18,889
How about this?

1167
01:32:20,849 --> 01:32:23,143
No matter what happens down there...

1168
01:32:24,435 --> 01:32:26,980
...l can't bring none of that shit
back home with us.

1169
01:32:27,063 --> 01:32:28,357
Can't let it happen.

1170
01:32:29,858 --> 01:32:31,308
L'll do whatever l have to...

1171
01:32:31,443 --> 01:32:33,152
...to see that it doesn't.

1172
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:36,531
Make sure you do, captain.

1173
01:32:52,088 --> 01:32:54,215
So you came after all.

1174
01:32:54,508 --> 01:32:56,051
I thought you wanted me to.

1175
01:32:56,343 --> 01:32:58,929
After all your attempts
to stop me from coming here...

1176
01:32:59,012 --> 01:33:00,430
...l'm surprised to see you.

1177
01:33:01,181 --> 01:33:02,431
It's all right. Leave us.

1178
01:33:02,975 --> 01:33:04,393
Yes, sir.

1179
01:33:16,446 --> 01:33:17,113
If you're...

1180
01:33:17,322 --> 01:33:19,022
...going down there, you will die.

1181
01:33:22,077 --> 01:33:24,027
Very negative way of looking at things.

1182
01:33:26,122 --> 01:33:28,572
That's exactly why
you should have stayed at home.

1183
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:32,045
Did you really think l was gonna
sit in a boardroom for years...

1184
01:33:32,128 --> 01:33:33,879
...arguing over who was in charge...

1185
01:33:33,962 --> 01:33:37,300
...while you go look for some miracle
on some...

1186
01:33:37,467 --> 01:33:41,137
...godforsaken rock
in the middle of space?

1187
01:33:44,056 --> 01:33:45,807
A king has...

1188
01:33:45,932 --> 01:33:48,519
...his reign, and then he dies.

1189
01:33:49,395 --> 01:33:50,771
It's inevitable.

1190
01:33:53,273 --> 01:33:54,609
That...

1191
01:33:55,318 --> 01:33:57,320
...is the natural order of things.

1192
01:34:10,165 --> 01:34:11,542
Anything else?

1193
01:34:13,418 --> 01:34:14,795
No...

1194
01:34:16,088 --> 01:34:17,673
...Father.

1195
01:34:19,258 --> 01:34:20,133
That's it.

1196
01:34:33,189 --> 01:34:34,839
I didn't think you had it in you.

1197
01:34:35,691 --> 01:34:36,317
Sorry.

1198
01:34:36,483 --> 01:34:38,860
Poor choice of words.

1199
01:34:40,153 --> 01:34:43,449
Extraordinary survival instincts,
Elizabeth.

1200
01:34:48,454 --> 01:34:50,204
What happens when Weyland is not...

1201
01:34:50,289 --> 01:34:51,540
...around to program you?

1202
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:54,209
I suppose l'll be free.

1203
01:34:55,128 --> 01:34:56,462
You want that?

1204
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:58,172
"Want"?

1205
01:34:58,339 --> 01:35:00,216
Not a concept l'm familiar with.

1206
01:35:00,508 --> 01:35:02,051
That being said...

1207
01:35:03,093 --> 01:35:05,243
...doesn't everyone
want their parents dead?

1208
01:35:07,139 --> 01:35:08,182
I didn't.

1209
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:10,183
Dr. Shaw.

1210
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:13,260
So pleased you could join us.

1211
01:35:28,035 --> 01:35:30,246
You can take your helmet off
if you like, sir.

1212
01:35:30,329 --> 01:35:31,162
What?

1213
01:35:31,246 --> 01:35:33,749
The air is perfectly breathable.

1214
01:35:33,915 --> 01:35:35,084
Are you sure?

1215
01:35:35,251 --> 01:35:36,252
Positive.

1216
01:35:36,794 --> 01:35:41,548
Wait. We still don't know how
Holloway got infected. lf it's in the air.

1217
01:35:42,132 --> 01:35:43,550
It's not.

1218
01:35:43,842 --> 01:35:45,593
How do you know that?

1219
01:35:45,885 --> 01:35:46,886
Smells fine to me.

1220
01:35:49,556 --> 01:35:50,932
- Shall we?
- Please.

1221
01:35:56,437 --> 01:35:58,189
The bridge is just up ahead.

1222
01:35:58,356 --> 01:35:59,440
What is this?

1223
01:36:00,608 --> 01:36:02,444
It's a cargo hold.

1224
01:36:11,494 --> 01:36:14,122
Janek? Are you seeing this?

1225
01:36:15,416 --> 01:36:16,625
How many is there, Shaw?

1226
01:36:16,792 --> 01:36:17,625
Thousands.

1227
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,837
What the hell?

1228
01:36:24,674 --> 01:36:26,592
Ravel, give me those schematics.

1229
01:36:29,471 --> 01:36:31,598
Putting it on the table now.

1230
01:36:32,974 --> 01:36:33,975
Strip away the dome.

1231
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,395
Isolate that area, bring it up.

1232
01:36:37,562 --> 01:36:39,189
Bringing it up, captain.

1233
01:36:42,276 --> 01:36:43,360
Enlarge that.

1234
01:36:45,487 --> 01:36:46,821
Rotate it.

1235
01:36:50,908 --> 01:36:52,451
That is a ship.

1236
01:36:53,411 --> 01:36:54,955
Jesus Christ.

1237
01:36:56,915 --> 01:36:58,958
It's a goddamn ship.

1238
01:37:02,129 --> 01:37:04,839
A superior species, no doubt.

1239
01:37:07,133 --> 01:37:09,678
Their hypersleep chambers...

1240
01:37:09,845 --> 01:37:12,556
...will impress, l trust.

1241
01:37:21,522 --> 01:37:22,190
So they...

1242
01:37:22,357 --> 01:37:26,152
- ...were traveling somewhere.
- L've managed to work out the broad strokes.

1243
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:29,197
It's fairly evident
they were in the process of leaving...

1244
01:37:31,158 --> 01:37:33,326
...before things went to pot.

1245
01:37:33,618 --> 01:37:34,995
Leaving to go where?

1246
01:37:36,872 --> 01:37:37,705
Earth.

1247
01:37:38,874 --> 01:37:39,707
Why?

1248
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:42,752
Sometimes to create...

1249
01:37:43,086 --> 01:37:44,837
...one must first destroy.

1250
01:37:47,048 --> 01:37:48,383
Where is he, David?

1251
01:37:49,676 --> 01:37:50,719
This way, sir.

1252
01:37:57,141 --> 01:37:58,559
Are you sure he's alive?

1253
01:38:00,352 --> 01:38:01,395
Absolutely.

1254
01:38:05,858 --> 01:38:07,276
And you can speak to him?

1255
01:38:07,568 --> 01:38:09,069
I believe l can.

1256
01:38:45,355 --> 01:38:46,940
I'm all right, l'm all right.

1257
01:38:48,776 --> 01:38:50,027
Speak to him, David.

1258
01:38:51,362 --> 01:38:53,212
Tell him we came, just like he asked.

1259
01:38:53,322 --> 01:38:54,472
Ask where they're from.

1260
01:38:55,074 --> 01:38:56,024
What are you doing?

1261
01:38:56,117 --> 01:38:57,785
Ask him what's in his cargo.

1262
01:38:57,952 --> 01:38:58,870
It killed his people.

1263
01:38:58,953 --> 01:39:00,079
Shaw, enough.

1264
01:39:00,371 --> 01:39:02,122
- David.
- You made it here...

1265
01:39:02,623 --> 01:39:05,292
...and it was meant for us. Why?

1266
01:39:05,459 --> 01:39:07,294
Enough. For God's sake, shut her up.

1267
01:39:09,463 --> 01:39:10,547
I need to know why!

1268
01:39:10,756 --> 01:39:12,506
What did we do wrong? Why do you...

1269
01:39:12,674 --> 01:39:14,176
- ...hate us?
- She opens her...

1270
01:39:14,259 --> 01:39:15,387
...mouth again, shoot her.

1271
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:17,388
David, continue. Tell him why l came.

1272
01:39:38,283 --> 01:39:39,116
No!

1273
01:39:45,166 --> 01:39:46,166
Ford! Move!

1274
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:09,064
There's nothing.

1275
01:40:14,193 --> 01:40:15,988
I know.

1276
01:40:16,697 --> 01:40:19,658
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.

1277
01:40:26,122 --> 01:40:27,706
Time to go home.

1278
01:40:41,137 --> 01:40:44,224
Mr. Chance, take us home.

1279
01:41:57,255 --> 01:41:58,131
Oh, no!

1280
01:42:05,972 --> 01:42:06,973
Hey, cap.

1281
01:42:07,515 --> 01:42:08,665
What the hell was that?

1282
01:42:52,851 --> 01:42:53,684
Prometheus!

1283
01:42:54,144 --> 01:42:55,187
Come in!

1284
01:42:56,022 --> 01:42:57,273
Shaw, is that you?

1285
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,273
Copy.

1286
01:42:58,357 --> 01:42:59,024
Janek...

1287
01:42:59,191 --> 01:43:00,192
...listen to me.

1288
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:02,361
This ship is taking off!

1289
01:43:02,528 --> 01:43:04,238
- What?
- What is she talking about?

1290
01:43:04,321 --> 01:43:05,906
You can't let it leave!

1291
01:43:06,156 --> 01:43:07,198
You have to stop it!

1292
01:43:07,532 --> 01:43:10,160
We're not stopping anything, Shaw.
We're going home.

1293
01:43:10,661 --> 01:43:12,704
Janek, if you don't stop it...

1294
01:43:12,871 --> 01:43:14,921
...there won't be any home to go back to.

1295
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:19,336
It's carrying death, and
it's headed for Earth.

1296
01:43:19,628 --> 01:43:22,005
- Shaw, this is not a warship.
- L know.

1297
01:43:22,214 --> 01:43:23,047
Let's go.

1298
01:43:23,174 --> 01:43:24,383
I know that.

1299
01:43:25,051 --> 01:43:26,844
But you must do it.

1300
01:43:27,386 --> 01:43:29,054
Captain, let's go!

1301
01:43:29,263 --> 01:43:31,306
Janek, please believe me! Please!

1302
01:43:46,989 --> 01:43:49,409
I told you to get this ship going.

1303
01:43:49,617 --> 01:43:50,450
Mr. Ravel.

1304
01:43:50,576 --> 01:43:51,926
Warm up the ion propulsion.

1305
01:43:52,244 --> 01:43:53,994
- What are you talking about?
- Sir.

1306
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:55,748
Burning ion in the atmosphere...

1307
01:43:55,914 --> 01:43:59,084
- Turns us into a bullet. That's the point.
- What are you doing?

1308
01:43:59,167 --> 01:44:00,919
This is my ship. l'm telling you...

1309
01:44:01,086 --> 01:44:02,170
...to take us home!

1310
01:44:02,338 --> 01:44:03,923
Vickers, l'll eject your module onto...

1311
01:44:04,006 --> 01:44:05,757
...that surface. Two years of life.

1312
01:44:05,966 --> 01:44:08,016
You want it, or you want to stay with me?

1313
01:44:08,843 --> 01:44:10,243
You got 40 seconds to get...

1314
01:44:10,346 --> 01:44:11,396
...to the escape pod.

1315
01:44:11,514 --> 01:44:12,598
You're crazy.

1316
01:44:12,765 --> 01:44:13,598
Gentlemen...

1317
01:44:14,141 --> 01:44:15,768
...l can handle this myself.

1318
01:44:16,269 --> 01:44:17,979
Feel free to join Miss Vickers.

1319
01:44:18,896 --> 01:44:20,272
All due respect, captain.

1320
01:44:20,439 --> 01:44:23,739
You're a shit pilot and you're gonna
need all the help you can get.

1321
01:44:39,957 --> 01:44:44,129
Well, if you can't be
with the one you love

1322
01:44:44,296 --> 01:44:46,506
lf you think this means the bet's off...

1323
01:44:47,882 --> 01:44:49,133
...you're wrong.

1324
01:44:50,801 --> 01:44:53,137
Why don't you pay me on the other side?

1325
01:44:53,304 --> 01:44:55,389
All right, get us as close as we can.

1326
01:44:55,556 --> 01:44:57,475
Only got one shot at this.

1327
01:45:10,572 --> 01:45:11,405
Lifeboats away!

1328
01:45:16,494 --> 01:45:17,453
Twenty seconds...

1329
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:18,621
...to evacuate.

1330
01:45:26,504 --> 01:45:28,381
- Countdown initiated.
- Lon propulsion...

1331
01:45:28,464 --> 01:45:29,297
...is online.

1332
01:45:29,549 --> 01:45:30,382
Ten.

1333
01:45:30,675 --> 01:45:31,508
Nine.

1334
01:45:31,634 --> 01:45:32,510
Come on!

1335
01:45:32,677 --> 01:45:33,678
Eight.

1336
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:47,274
- Three.
- Let's do this.

1337
01:45:47,441 --> 01:45:48,317
Two.

1338
01:45:51,654 --> 01:45:52,530
Impact imminent.

1339
01:45:52,697 --> 01:45:54,115
Hands off!

1340
01:46:30,986 --> 01:46:31,819
Oh, God.

1341
01:47:19,283 --> 01:47:20,284
No. No.

1342
01:47:20,492 --> 01:47:21,535
No! No! No!

1343
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:38,885
Oh, God.

1344
01:47:55,319 --> 01:47:58,613
Warning: You have two minutes
of oxygen remaining.

1345
01:48:47,037 --> 01:48:50,874
Warning: You have 30 seconds
of oxygen remaining.

1346
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:05,596
Airlock sealed.

1347
01:49:07,223 --> 01:49:09,726
Oxygen levels now stabilizing.

1348
01:50:27,678 --> 01:50:29,638
Elizabeth, are you there?

1349
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:31,349
This is David.

1350
01:50:32,559 --> 01:50:35,061
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, l'm here.

1351
01:50:35,353 --> 01:50:37,647
You need to get out immediately.

1352
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:39,815
He's coming for you.

1353
01:50:40,065 --> 01:50:41,108
Who's coming?

1354
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:42,776
Airlock breach.

1355
01:50:51,369 --> 01:50:52,412
Die!

1356
01:52:17,955 --> 01:52:20,416
I'm so sorry.

1357
01:52:21,917 --> 01:52:23,752
Oh, God.

1358
01:52:24,377 --> 01:52:25,754
I'm sorry.

1359
01:52:25,962 --> 01:52:29,382
I'm sorry, Charlie, l can't do it.

1360
01:52:29,549 --> 01:52:32,719
I can't do it anymore.

1361
01:52:36,139 --> 01:52:37,599
Elizabeth.

1362
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:40,769
Are you there?

1363
01:52:45,316 --> 01:52:46,775
Dr. Shaw...

1364
01:52:47,484 --> 01:52:48,777
...can you hear me?

1365
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:51,321
Yes.

1366
01:52:52,781 --> 01:52:54,949
Yes, l can hear you.

1367
01:52:55,491 --> 01:52:57,369
I was afraid you were dead.

1368
01:52:59,121 --> 01:53:02,082
You have no idea what afraid is.

1369
01:53:02,916 --> 01:53:05,711
I know we've had our differences...

1370
01:53:07,129 --> 01:53:08,588
...but, please...

1371
01:53:09,506 --> 01:53:11,801
...l need to ask you for your help.

1372
01:53:11,967 --> 01:53:14,511
Why the hell would l help you?

1373
01:53:16,263 --> 01:53:20,141
Because, without me,
you'll never leave this place.

1374
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:23,979
Neither one of us is leaving this place.

1375
01:53:24,438 --> 01:53:26,481
It's not the only ship.

1376
01:53:28,358 --> 01:53:30,443
There are many others.

1377
01:53:31,819 --> 01:53:33,154
I can operate them.

1378
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:43,748
Dr. Shaw?

1379
01:53:56,552 --> 01:53:57,762
Dr. Shaw!

1380
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:00,348
Over here.

1381
01:54:06,062 --> 01:54:08,022
Where is my cross?

1382
01:54:08,523 --> 01:54:10,399
The pouch in my utility belt.

1383
01:54:29,168 --> 01:54:30,962
Even after all this...

1384
01:54:31,212 --> 01:54:33,214
...you still believe, don't you?

1385
01:54:34,048 --> 01:54:37,051
You said you could
understand their navigation...

1386
01:54:37,593 --> 01:54:38,844
...use their maps.

1387
01:54:40,846 --> 01:54:42,556
Yes, of course.

1388
01:54:42,723 --> 01:54:45,059
Once we get to one of their other ships...

1389
01:54:45,226 --> 01:54:48,376
...finding a path to Earth
should be relatively straightforward.

1390
01:54:49,063 --> 01:54:52,025
I don't want to go back
to where we came from.

1391
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:56,529
I want to go where they came from.

1392
01:54:57,906 --> 01:55:00,325
Do you think you can do that, David?

1393
01:55:04,203 --> 01:55:05,412
Yes.

1394
01:55:06,038 --> 01:55:07,915
I believe l can.

1395
01:55:17,258 --> 01:55:19,886
May l ask what you hope to achieve
by going there?

1396
01:55:20,553 --> 01:55:22,638
They created us.

1397
01:55:22,847 --> 01:55:24,391
Then they tried to kill us.

1398
01:55:24,933 --> 01:55:26,851
They changed their minds.

1399
01:55:28,436 --> 01:55:30,062
I deserve to know why.

1400
01:55:32,314 --> 01:55:33,899
The answer is irrelevant.

1401
01:55:34,942 --> 01:55:37,236
Does it matter why
they changed their minds?

1402
01:55:37,945 --> 01:55:39,113
Yes.

1403
01:55:40,448 --> 01:55:42,116
Yes, it does.

1404
01:55:43,117 --> 01:55:44,284
I don't understand.

1405
01:55:45,786 --> 01:55:46,912
Well...

1406
01:55:48,955 --> 01:55:52,000
...l guess that's because
l'm a human being...

1407
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:53,669
...and you're a robot.

1408
01:56:03,469 --> 01:56:04,429
I'm sorry.

1409
01:56:04,596 --> 01:56:05,764
It's quite all right.

1410
01:56:20,988 --> 01:56:23,782
Final report of the vessel Prometheus.

1411
01:56:23,949 --> 01:56:24,908
The ship and her...

1412
01:56:25,075 --> 01:56:27,201
...entire crew are gone.

1413
01:56:27,410 --> 01:56:29,370
If you're receiving this transmission...

1414
01:56:29,453 --> 01:56:32,832
...make no attempt
to come to its point of origin.

1415
01:56:32,999 --> 01:56:37,212
There is only death here now,
and l'm leaving it behind.

1416
01:56:38,297 --> 01:56:40,090
It is New Year's Day...

1417
01:56:40,257 --> 01:56:43,301
...the year of our Lord, 2094.

1418
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:46,722
My name is Elizabeth Shaw...

1419
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:49,850
...the last survivor of the Prometheus.

1420
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:52,852
And l am still searching.

1
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,886
Where are you going?

2
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,606
I won't be long.

3
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,604
Welcome, Signor Sciarra.

4
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,169
I trust you had a pleasant journey.

5
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:12,488
Do you have it?

6
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,010
Yes. It's over there.

7
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:22,202
When do we blow the stadium?

8
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,608
This evening at six.

9
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,683
And the flight out of here?

10
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,365
All arranged.

11
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,806
And then what?

12
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,171
Then I visit The Pale King.

13
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:43,969
A toast, my friend.

14
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,048
To Death!

15
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:54,527
Bottoms up.

16
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,642
Meet me in the square!

17
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:09,845
<i>I've been here before.</i>

18
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:17,324
<i>But always hit the floor.</i>

19
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:22,722
<i>I've spent a lifetime running.</i>

20
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,486
<i>And I always get away.</i>

21
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:30,246
<i>But with you I'm feeling something.</i>

22
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:34,006
<i>That makes me want to stay.</i>

23
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:40,367
<i>If I risk it all.</i>

24
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:47,682
<i>Could you break my fall?</i>

25
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:51,922
<i>How do I live? How do I breathe?</i>

26
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,369
<i>When you're not here I'm suffocating.</i>

27
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:58,967
<i>I want to feel love run through my blood.</i>

28
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,886
<i>Tell me is this where I give it all up?</i>

29
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,207
<i>For you I have to risk it all</i>

30
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:17,245
<i>'Cause the writing's on the wall.</i>

31
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:27,562
<i>A million shards of glass.</i>

32
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:34,847
<i>That haunt me from my past.</i>

33
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:39,847
<i>As the stars begin to gather.</i>

34
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,528
<i>And the light begins to fade.</i>

35
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:47,161
<i>When all hope begins to shatter.</i>

36
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:51,371
<i>Know that I won't be afraid.</i>

37
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:58,568
<i>If I risk it all.</i>

38
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:04,487
<i>Could you break my fall?</i>

39
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,562
<i>How do I live? How do I breathe?</i>

40
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,087
<i>When you're not here I'm suffocating.</i>

41
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,881
<i>I want to feel love run through my blood.</i>

42
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:20,045
<i>Tell me is this where I give it all up?</i>

43
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:26,481
<i>For you I have to risk it all</i>

44
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,491
<i>'Cause the writing's on the wall.</i>

45
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:42,967
<i>The writing's on the wall.</i>

46
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:03,725
<i>How do I live? How do I breathe?</i>

47
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,283
<i>When you're not here I'm suffocating.</i>

48
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:11,207
<i>I want to feel love run through my blood.</i>

49
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,524
<i>Tell me is this where I give it all up?</i>

50
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,880
<i>For you I have to risk it all</i>

51
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:30,048
<i>'Cause the writing's on.</i>

52
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,370
<i>The wall.</i>

53
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:45,765
Start anywhere you like.

54
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,882
Take your time, 007, but in five minutes

55
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:49,167
the head of the Joint Security Service

56
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,481
is going to walk through that door,

57
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:51,766
and I've got to explain to him

58
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:55,083
how one of our agents decided
to potter off to Mexico, all on his own,

59
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,845
and cause an international incident.

60
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,158
With all due respect, sir,
it could've been worse.

61
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:01,322
Worse? You blew up
half a bloody block.

62
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,157
Well, better half a block than
a whole stadium full of people.

63
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,083
You had no authority.

64
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,722
None.

65
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:09,963
As you know, we're in the
middle of the biggest shakeup

66
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,565
in the history of British intelligence.

67
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,406
The ink's barely dry
on this merger with MI5

68
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,290
and already they're itching
for a chance to scrap

69
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:18,011
the double-0 program forever.

70
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:20,368
And you've just given them one.

71
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,804
You're right, sir.

72
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:25,487
You have got a tricky day ahead.

73
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:30,601
This is an official question.

74
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,923
Mexico City.
What were you doing there?

75
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:39,561
It was just a coincidence.
I was taking some overdue holiday.

76
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:42,771
Okay. Fine.

77
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,092
As of this morning,
you are officially grounded.

78
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,802
I'm standing you down
from all operations indefinitely.

79
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,565
Very good, sir.

80
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,926
007?

81
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,487
Sir?

82
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:06,326
I don't know what you're playing at,

83
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,052
but whatever it is, it has to stop.

84
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,121
Now.

85
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,642
So sorry. Am I interrupting?
Not remotely.

86
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,688
007, I'd like you to meet Max Denbigh,

87
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:18,126
head of the Joint Security Service.

88
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,920
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, 007.
I've heard a lot about you.

89
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,121
Most of it good.

90
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,686
Congratulations on your new appointment.

91
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:24,761
Thank you.

92
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,325
I suppose we should call you C now.

93
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,323
No, no. "Max," please.

94
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,922
No, I think I'll call you C,

95
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,042
C.

96
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,291
As you wish.

97
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:38,160
Well, my door is always open, 007,
for my employees.

98
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:41,130
This merger's gonna be
a whole new chapter for us.

99
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,921
We're going to bring
British intelligence out of the Dark Ages

100
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,571
into the light.

101
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:49,771
That all sounds lovely.

102
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:53,041
That'll be all, 007. Report to Q
tomorrow for medical, thank you.

103
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:54,851
Very good, sir.

104
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,927
James?

105
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:07,002
Moneypenny.

106
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,641
So? How was the meeting?

107
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,530
Very good, thank you.

108
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,928
Here.

109
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,169
Forensics finally released this.
What is it?

110
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,290
It's personal effects
they recovered from Skyfall.

111
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,169
Perfect. You can
bring it to me later.

112
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,687
What do you mean?
My place, 9:00.

113
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,326
Evening.

114
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,680
Come in.

115
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,484
Have you just moved in?

116
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:42,562
No.

117
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,600
Well, I like what you've done
with the place.

118
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:48,285
Your delivery.

119
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:50,726
Thank you.

120
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:54,951
Would you like a drink?

121
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:56,561
No, thanks. I'm not staying.

122
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,802
That's a shame.

123
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,449
What's going on, James?

124
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,003
There's not one person at MI6
who isn't talking about it.

125
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:07,732
Talking about what, exactly?

126
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,531
That what you did in Mexico
was one step too far.

127
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,290
That you're finished.

128
00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:15,772
And what do you think?

129
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,243
I think you're just getting started.

130
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,603
I don't know what you mean.

131
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:23,092
All right.

132
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,488
I think you've got a secret.

133
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:30,091
And it's something you won't tell anyone.

134
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,963
Because you don't trust anyone.

135
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:47,765
<i>If anything happens to me, 007,
I need you to do something.</i>

136
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,563
<i>Find a man called Marco Sciarra.</i>

137
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,012
<i>Kill him.</i>

138
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,803
<i>And don't miss the funeral.</i>

139
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,292
Jesus.

140
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,650
Where did you get it?

141
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,200
In my mailbox just after she died.

142
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,082
Well, she was never short of surprises.

143
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,040
She wasn't gonna let death
get in the way of her job.

144
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,086
I've been tracking Sciarra ever since.

145
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,492
And what have you found?

146
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,924
Nothing significant yet.

147
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:22,408
When's the funeral?

148
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:25,688
Three days. In Rome.

149
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:28,804
If you think M's signing off on that,
you're insane.

150
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,371
He won't let you out of his sight.

151
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,681
Yes, it's a bit of a problem.

152
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,086
Listen.

153
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:37,445
Could you do a little
quiet digging for me?

154
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,532
I heard a name in Mexico.
"The Pale King."

155
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,810
You want me to be your mole.

156
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:47,608
Yes.

157
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,725
And what makes you think you can trust me?

158
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,691
Instinct.

159
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,403
Poor old girl.
Rigged for demolition in a week.

160
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:04,685
Cheaper to knock her down than to rebuild.

161
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:06,446
Still.

162
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:09,001
Time waits for no man and all that.

163
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:12,765
Anyway, all the money's
been spent on this,

164
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,365
the New Centre for National Security.

165
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,203
So that's C's new digs.

166
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,045
You've met him, have you?

167
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:24,248
Yesterday.
What do we know about him?

168
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,483
Classic Whitehall mandarin.

169
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:27,687
Wrote a dossier last year

170
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:29,797
on how the double-0 program was obsolete,

171
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,884
how drones could do
all our dirty work abroad.

172
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,726
Went to school with the Home Secretary.

173
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:36,291
Of course, he did.

174
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:38,648
This merger's just the start of it.

175
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,042
In three days, there's
a security conference in Tokyo

176
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:43,361
to decide the New World Order.

177
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,681
If C gets his way,
he'll have unlimited access

178
00:23:45,761 --> 00:23:48,492
to the combined intelligence streams
of nine countries.

179
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:49,766
Including us.

180
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:51,002
Quite.

181
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:02,641
Well, a lot's happened
while you were away.

182
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,805
A train bombing in Hamburg
and an industrial explosion in Tunisia.

183
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,451
It's not great timing for us.

184
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,246
It's all rather playing into C's hands.

185
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:15,246
M, well, let's say
he's feeling the pressure.

186
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,012
Yeah, I've noticed.

187
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,890
Now, this way, 007.

188
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,440
Be careful.
It's a trifle slippery.

189
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:26,641
Q wasn't exactly feeling at home
in Whitehall,

190
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,722
what with the new merger,

191
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:31,930
so he set up shop here,
away from prying eyes, as it were.

192
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:34,844
I hear he's got something rather
special planned for you.

193
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,604
I can hardly wait.

194
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,482
Ah, 007.

195
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,043
- Q.
- Please excuse the mess.

196
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,607
Everything's a little bit up in the air,

197
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,967
what with the changes and all.

198
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,361
Couple of things to get through.

199
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:00,050
Shall we get started?

200
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,012
Just relax.

201
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:04,842
That's it. Lovely.

202
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:06,964
Now, you may feel a small...

203
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,088
Christ!

204
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:09,522
Prick.

205
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,802
What is it?

206
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,610
Cutting-edge nanotechnology.

207
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,325
Smart Blood.

208
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:19,488
Microchips in your bloodstream.

209
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,643
Allows us to track
your movements in the field.

210
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:24,965
You see those readouts?

211
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:28,722
We can monitor your vital signs
from anywhere on the planet.

212
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:30,963
Well, that sounds marvelous.

213
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:34,170
Call it a post-Mexico insurance policy.

214
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,765
By direct order of M.

215
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,768
I completely understand.

216
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:42,407
Good.

217
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,370
Right. Well, I've just, um,
got one last thing for you

218
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,011
and you can be on your way.

219
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,843
Magnificent, isn't she?

220
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:00,522
Zero to 60 in three point two seconds.

221
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,968
Fully bulletproof.
A few little tricks up her sleeve.

222
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,725
It's a shame, really.
She was meant for you,

223
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,725
but she's been reassigned to 009.

224
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,929
But you can have this.

225
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,044
Does it do anything?

226
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,804
It tells the time.

227
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:24,204
Might help with your punctuality issues.

228
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:26,169
M's idea? Precisely.

229
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,286
Oh, one word of warning.
The alarm is rather loud.

230
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:33,884
If you know what I mean.

231
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,486
I think I do.

232
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:44,649
Oh, yes. That old thing
is taking quite a bit of time.

233
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:47,480
Mind you, there wasn't
much left to work on.

234
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:49,449
Only a steering wheel.

235
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:53,810
I believe I said, "Bring it back in one
piece," not, "Bring back one piece."

236
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,769
Anyway, enjoy your downtime, 007.

237
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,765
- Q?
- Yes?

238
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:10,361
Well, now you know exactly
where I am all of the time.

239
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:13,324
Will you do something for me?

240
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,847
What do you have in mind, exactly?

241
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,166
Make me disappear.

242
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,763
May I remind you that
I answer directly to M.

243
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:27,925
I also have a mortgage.
And two cats to feed.

244
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:30,686
Well, then I suggest you trust me,

245
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:33,044
for the sake of the cats.

246
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:40,604
Well, it's lovely to
see you, 007. Lovely.

247
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,127
Um, now, I meant to tell you,

248
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,046
the Smart Blood program is obviously
still in its developmental phase.

249
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:51,207
So we may experience the odd drop
in coverage during the first 24 hours...

250
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:56,649
48 hours after administration,

251
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,406
but after that it should work perfectly.

252
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:01,604
I'll send you a postcard.

253
00:28:02,121 --> 00:28:03,646
Please, don't.

254
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,802
Morning.

255
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,532
What's that?
Oh, it's just something from an admirer.

256
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,081
It's not your birthday, is it?

257
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:39,771
No, sir.

258
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,689
That was last week.

259
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:44,082
Morning.

260
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,006
009 has arrived to pick up the DB10, sir.
He's waiting upstairs.

261
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:49,923
Oh, good. Yes, fine.

262
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:06,685
Oh, shit.

263
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:12,523
I'm sorry for your loss.

264
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,526
You knew my husband?

265
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,130
All too briefly.

266
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,167
What do you do?

267
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,166
Life insurance.

268
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,685
A little late for that.

269
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:26,649
For your husband, yes.

270
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:29,090
But what about you?

271
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,086
Me?

272
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,449
I hear the life expectancy
of some widows can be very short.

273
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,762
How can you talk like this?

274
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:41,284
Can't you see I'm grieving?

275
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,160
No.

276
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,005
What a lovely view.

277
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:08,443
You're wasting your time.

278
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:11,530
There are 100 more
that will come after me.

279
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,925
All you buy me is five minutes.

280
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:17,365
Excellent.

281
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,490
Time for a drink.

282
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:31,090
You killed him,

283
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,206
didn't you?

284
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,566
My husband.

285
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:36,883
He was an assassin.

286
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:39,168
Trust me, he won't take it personally.

287
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,001
You signed my death warrant.
I was respected.

288
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:47,532
Loyal to a man you hated.

289
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,325
He trusted my silence.

290
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:51,688
With him gone, I'm a dead woman.

291
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,887
I can trust nobody.

292
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:53,961
I know the feeling well.

293
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:56,611
Well, I can tell you
that I don't trust you.

294
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,809
Well, then you have impeccable instincts.

295
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:01,452
If you don't leave now,
we'll die together.

296
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:06,407
I can think of worse ways to go.

297
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,566
Then you're obviously crazy, Mister...

298
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:14,686
Bond.

299
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,200
James Bond.

300
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,331
These people,

301
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:33,486
if you just knew what they could do.

302
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,682
The power they have.

303
00:35:37,121 --> 00:35:40,363
Did your husband ever mention
"The Pale King?"

304
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:42,521
No.

305
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,284
The organization,

306
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,689
they hardly ever meet.

307
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,363
But because of what happened
to my husband,

308
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:57,325
they meet tonight.

309
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:58,561
Why?

310
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,329
To choose a replacement.

311
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,202
Where?

312
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,887
The Palazzo Cardenza.

313
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,044
Midnight. Sounds like fun.

314
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:10,963
I might drop by.

315
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,448
He was obsessed.

316
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:18,008
He spent more time with them than with me.

317
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,802
Then the man was a fool.

318
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,890
Leaving your number?

319
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:39,050
I've called
an American friend of mine. Felix.

320
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,770
He'll contact his embassy
and get you out of here.

321
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:43,405
You'll be safe.

322
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,890
Don't go, James.

323
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,604
If you go there,

324
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,570
you're crossing over to a place
where there is no mercy.

325
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:00,166
I have to go.

326
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:57,762
Identify yourself, asshole.

327
00:37:58,441 --> 00:37:59,441
Who are you?

328
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,450
I'm Mickey Mouse. Who are <i>you?</i>

329
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,126
Pharmacy sites has provided

330
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,441
an excellent new sales platform.

331
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,925
We have adapted many of them
into clearinghouses for unapproved drugs.

332
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:30,925
In addition to which,

333
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:33,606
the latest figures show
that we presently control

334
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,001
70% of antimalarial vaccines,

335
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,807
34% of H.I.V.,
and 40% of all oncological drugs

336
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:44,289
across Sub-Saharan Africa.

337
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:48,041
But we face challenges from the WHO

338
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:51,887
in their campaign against
our counterfeit pharmaceuticals.

339
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,847
We have now identified
the key individuals to target.

340
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,284
We expect the same success as we had

341
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,682
against the Council on Human Trafficking.

342
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,081
Since the board's resignation...

343
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,200
we have placed 160,000 migrated females
into the leisure sector.

344
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:13,968
The impending completion of
the Global Surveillance initiative...

345
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:18,568
will mean our capability
is second to none...

346
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,363
and now is the moment
for aggressive expansion.

347
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,405
The news is only good...

348
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,369
Don't let me interrupt you.

349
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,202
The news is only good...

350
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,010
Our increased surveillance capability...

351
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:20,811
means government intelligence agencies...

352
00:40:20,881 --> 00:40:22,883
are easily counteracted.

353
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:25,566
We are winning.

354
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:27,452
Thank you, Doctor.

355
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:30,367
Now, on to the matter at hand.

356
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,526
After the success of our attacks
in Hamburg and Tunisia,

357
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:37,001
the aborted attack in Mexico City

358
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:41,006
and the death of our valued colleague,
Marco Sciarra,

359
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:44,169
leaves one of his duties outstanding.

360
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:47,689
<i>Signor</i> Guerra,
The Pale King must be terminated.

361
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,092
Will you make the journey to Altaussee?

362
00:40:54,921 --> 00:40:57,082
Of course.

363
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,925
My loyalty to this organization is total.

364
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:02,244
I will protect it with my last breath.

365
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,927
There will be no more...

366
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:07,606
amateurs.

367
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,287
No more shows of weakness.

368
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,885
Does anyone challenge
<i>Signor</i> Guerra for this position?

369
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,282
Welcome.

370
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,126
State your credentials
for succeeding <i>Signor</i> Sciarra.

371
00:43:13,121 --> 00:43:14,485
It's funny.

372
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:21,126
All that excitement
in Mexico City rang a distant bell.

373
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,526
And now,

374
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:29,323
suddenly, this evening,
it makes perfect sense.

375
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,644
Welcome, James.

376
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,204
It's been a long time.

377
00:43:43,481 --> 00:43:45,847
But, finally, here we are.

378
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,883
What took you so long?

379
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,365
Cuckoo.

380
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,970
Ciao, Mickey Mouse.

381
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:26,403
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

382
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:45,642
No.

383
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,371
Moneypenny.

384
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,361
Bond?

385
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:02,204
Listen, Moneypenny.
Hamburg, Tunisia,

386
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,965
Mexico City, they're all linked.

387
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:06,726
It's one organization
coordinating multiple attacks.

388
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,131
So, she was right.

389
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,361
<i>Of course, she was.</i>

390
00:47:09,441 --> 00:47:11,443
- I ran that check.
- Who is it?

391
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,963
Oh, my boss had his credit card stolen.

392
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,282
It's nothing.
Why don't you go back to sleep.

393
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,361
Don't be long.

394
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:21,044
- Who was that?
<i>- No one.</i>

395
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,521
<i>No, it wasn't.</i>

396
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:23,807
It's just a friend.

397
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:25,006
At this time of night?

398
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:28,209
It's called life, James.
You should try it sometime.

399
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:38,164
<i>The Pale King. It looks like
you've had dealings with him before.</i>

400
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,572
<i>Quantum.</i> Of course.

401
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,642
Mr. White! <i>That's him.</i>

402
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,968
Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria, four months ago.

403
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,727
Hold that thought.

404
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:03,568
You still there? Yeah.

405
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,006
Run another name, will you?

406
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:06,923
Okay. Go.

407
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,925
A man called
Franz Oberhauser. He's...

408
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:15,526
And check his files
before and after his death.

409
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,365
After his death?
What are you talking about?

410
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:19,363
Please, just do it.

411
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,561
Okay, Q, give me something.

412
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,285
That's more like it.

413
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:07,602
Here goes nothing.

414
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,691
Good evening.

415
00:51:02,921 --> 00:51:06,209
<i>Do not let them tell you
we need less surveillance.</i>

416
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:09,126
<i>We need more. Much more.</i>

417
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,092
<i>I say again, the Nine Eyes committee
would have full access</i>

418
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,369
<i>to the combined intelligence streams
of all member states.</i>

419
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,602
<i>More data, more analysis,</i>

420
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:22,851
<i>less likelihood of a terrorist attack.</i>

421
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,206
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

422
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,130
<i>it's time for the security services
of the world to unite.</i>

423
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,445
<i>Alone, we are weak.</i>

424
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:35,365
<i>Together, we're a global power.</i>

425
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,291
An unelected one.

426
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,092
<i>Thank you.</i>

427
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,481
Thank you.

428
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,249
We will now vote on the resolution.

429
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,644
Ladies and gentlemen,
please cast your vote.

430
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:56,003
The vote is eight to one in favor.

431
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:58,130
However, as you know,

432
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,171
we cannot proceed
unless by unanimous vote.

433
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,405
The Nine Eyes motion
is therefore not passed.

434
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,481
Democracy.

435
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:07,597
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

436
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,921
This evening's session is adjourned.

437
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:26,441
Yes, sir.

438
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:28,842
Please, tell me 007 is in London.

439
00:52:28,921 --> 00:52:30,001
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

440
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,892
Um, I'll just take a look now, sir.

441
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:35,011
Because if he isn't, you're in deep shit.

442
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,369
<i>You've got precisely 10 seconds.</i>

443
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:45,285
I have him, sir.
He appears to be in Chelsea.

444
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,729
Well, I want eyes on him
when I get back, understood?

445
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,128
I completely understand,

446
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,361
sir.

447
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,606
Do me a favor. Make it quick.

448
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:50,805
Upstairs, Mr. White.

449
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,006
I always knew death would wear
a familiar face,

450
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:06,570
but not yours.

451
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,564
To what do I owe
this pleasure, Mr. Bond?

452
00:56:11,961 --> 00:56:14,247
I was at a meeting recently

453
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,209
and your name came up.

454
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,291
I'm flattered London is still
talking about me.

455
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,851
It wasn't MI6.

456
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,206
It was Rome.

457
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:26,369
Your team, not mine.

458
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,762
Ah.

459
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:36,764
Last month,
I found thallium in my cell phone.

460
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,410
It's done its job.
I have a few weeks. Maybe less.

461
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,805
So, here we are, Mr. Bond,

462
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,972
two dead men enjoying the evening.

463
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,206
What did you do?

464
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,930
I disobeyed him.

465
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,767
I followed him as far as I could.

466
00:56:58,441 --> 00:56:59,727
He changed.

467
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:01,367
Oh, I see.

468
00:57:02,121 --> 00:57:03,724
You grew a conscience.

469
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,211
Our game is our game. But this?

470
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,441
Women, children...

471
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,372
Well, the thallium would suggest

472
00:57:12,441 --> 00:57:14,488
that he doesn't like you
very much anymore.

473
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:16,450
And clearly the feeling is mutual.

474
00:57:16,521 --> 00:57:18,727
So why don't you tell me
how to find him again?

475
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,802
Oh, come on.

476
00:57:20,881 --> 00:57:22,371
Tell me where he is.

477
00:57:22,441 --> 00:57:24,169
He's everywhere.

478
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:25,528
Everywhere!

479
00:57:25,881 --> 00:57:27,769
He's sitting at your desk,

480
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,084
he's kissing your lover,
he's eating supper with your family!

481
00:57:38,481 --> 00:57:40,563
You're protecting someone.

482
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,682
Your wife.

483
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,003
She left long ago.

484
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,052
Your son?

485
00:57:54,121 --> 00:57:55,849
Your daughter.

486
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,765
You won't find her.

487
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,331
She's clever.

488
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:04,530
She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.

489
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:08,601
I can protect her if
you tell me where he is.

490
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,965
I can keep her alive.

491
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:14,202
Yeah.

492
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:18,360
You have my word.

493
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:19,646
Your word?

494
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,530
The word of an assassin!

495
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:36,570
That's my word.

496
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:05,965
<i>L'Américain.</i>

497
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,809
You save her,

498
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:11,581
she can lead you to <i>L'Américain.</i>
She knows <i>L'Américain.</i>

499
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,843
Try the Hoffler Klinik.

500
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:26,090
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane,
Mr. Bond.

501
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,441
So long.

502
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,970
I can't deny I'm impressed
you got H.M.G. to cough up for all this.

503
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:29,521
Good God, the government couldn't
afford this kind of facility.

504
01:00:29,561 --> 01:00:32,291
No, it was benefactors mostly,
from the private sector.

505
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,887
When it goes online,

506
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:35,769
this building will be
the most sophisticated

507
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,809
data gathering system in history.

508
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:40,885
The world's digital ghost, available 24/7.

509
01:00:40,961 --> 01:00:42,610
George Orwell's worst nightmare.

510
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,842
I'm glad you like it.

511
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,204
My commiserations
on losing the Nine Eyes vote.

512
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,361
Must have been a blow.

513
01:00:48,441 --> 01:00:50,602
Not really.
Only a matter of time

514
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,921
before the South Africans see the light.

515
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:54,242
And you know what they say,
Rome wasn't built in a day.

516
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,370
Day and a half maybe.

517
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,523
Look, Max, I know
surveillance is a fact of life.

518
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:03,731
It's how you use the information
that concerns me,

519
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,285
and who is using it.

520
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,860
This is what we need to do
to keep the people safe.

521
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,887
Double-0 program is prehistoric.

522
01:01:11,521 --> 01:01:13,967
Come on, M. You can't really
tell me that one man in the field

523
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:15,769
can compete with all of this,

524
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,572
running around out there
with his license to kill.

525
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,802
Have you ever had to kill a man, Max?

526
01:01:23,441 --> 01:01:24,646
Have you?

527
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,407
To pull that trigger, you have to be sure.

528
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,486
Yes, you investigate,
analyze, assess, target.

529
01:01:32,561 --> 01:01:34,689
And then you have to look him in the eye.

530
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:37,771
And you make the call.

531
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,403
And all the drones, bugs,
cameras, transcripts,

532
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:43,483
all the surveillance in the world

533
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:45,961
can't tell you what to do next.

534
01:01:47,921 --> 01:01:49,649
A license to kill

535
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:53,244
is also a license not to kill.

536
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,606
I didn't want to have to do this,

537
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,691
but it looks like you still can't
control your agents.

538
01:02:02,921 --> 01:02:05,048
<i>Bond? I ran that check.</i>

539
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,372
<i>Looks like you've had
dealings with him before. Quantum.</i>

540
01:02:09,441 --> 01:02:11,249
<i>Of course. Mr. White!</i>

541
01:02:11,521 --> 01:02:14,764
<i>Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria.</i>

542
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,331
<i>Run another name, will you?</i>

543
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:18,682
So maybe there's something to be said

544
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,729
for total surveillance after all.

545
01:02:23,961 --> 01:02:26,008
You watch MI6 agents?

546
01:02:27,521 --> 01:02:29,204
We watch everyone.

547
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:36,852
Please, take a seat.

548
01:03:36,921 --> 01:03:38,968
I'll be with you in just a moment.

549
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,407
Please excuse me, Mr. Bond.

550
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,200
My name is Dr. Madeleine Swann.

551
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,124
Our job today is to analyze your needs,

552
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,727
both psychological and physical.

553
01:04:06,881 --> 01:04:08,631
Hmm, sounds pretty straightforward.

554
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,122
I hope you don't mind.
The view can be distracting.

555
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,885
I hadn't noticed.

556
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,967
I see you filled out
most of the paperwork.

557
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:27,247
Just a few questions to
complete your evaluation, if I may.

558
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,410
Do you exercise?

559
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,001
When I have to.

560
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,830
Do you consider your employment to be
psychologically stressful?

561
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,842
Sometimes.

562
01:04:37,401 --> 01:04:39,001
How much alcohol do you consume?

563
01:04:39,921 --> 01:04:41,046
Too much.

564
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:45,530
Some broader questions.

565
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:48,077
As a child, would you say
you were close to your parents?

566
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,606
My parents died when I was young.

567
01:04:51,481 --> 01:04:53,084
Really? How old?

568
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,086
Old enough to remember.

569
01:04:55,481 --> 01:04:56,845
How, if I may ask?

570
01:04:56,921 --> 01:04:58,365
It was a climbing accident.

571
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,282
So who brought you up?

572
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:01,851
Someone else.

573
01:05:02,601 --> 01:05:03,840
Humor me.

574
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,566
How does one train at Oxford
and the Sorbonne become a consultant,

575
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,689
spend two years with
<i>Médecins Sans Frontières</i>

576
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,365
and end up here?

577
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:16,887
Forgive me, but anyone might think

578
01:05:16,961 --> 01:05:18,610
you were hiding from something.

579
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:22,881
You're paying a lot of money
to be here, Mr. Bond.

580
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:25,361
Who's asking the questions, you or me?

581
01:05:25,441 --> 01:05:27,488
Of course. Carry on.

582
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:33,851
I see you left this final question blank.

583
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:35,965
What is your occupation?

584
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:39,840
Well, that's not the sort of thing
that looks good on a form.

585
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:41,166
And why is that?

586
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,242
I kill people.

587
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:46,606
Small world?

588
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,322
Where is he?

589
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,325
Your father's dead.

590
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:54,086
Two days ago.

591
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,686
How do you know?

592
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,325
Because I was there.

593
01:05:57,921 --> 01:05:59,001
Did you kill him?

594
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:00,128
I didn't have to.

595
01:06:00,921 --> 01:06:02,490
He did it himself.

596
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,325
And you came all the way
just to tell me this?

597
01:06:06,961 --> 01:06:08,372
That my father's dead?

598
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,481
I came to tell you that your life is in
danger and I need your help.

599
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,361
Why? I made a deal
with him to protect you.

600
01:06:17,521 --> 01:06:18,965
You're lying.

601
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:20,852
Why would he trust you?

602
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:23,970
Because he knew that
I needed something in return.

603
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,601
And what was that?

604
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,771
To find <i>L'Américain.</i>

605
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,441
This interview is over.

606
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:31,760
Dr. Swann...

607
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:36,084
You have 10 minutes to leave the building.
Then I'm calling security.

608
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,490
Thank you, Dr. Swann.

609
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,285
Can I get you something, sir?

610
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,807
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.

611
01:07:07,881 --> 01:07:10,486
I'm sorry, we don't serve alcohol.

612
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:13,168
I'm really starting to love this place.

613
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,608
He'll have the prolytic
digestive enzyme shake.

614
01:07:15,921 --> 01:07:16,968
Certainly.

615
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,646
If you've come for the car,

616
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,325
I parked it at the bottom of the Tiber.

617
01:07:20,401 --> 01:07:23,405
Well, not to worry, 007.
It was only a £3,000,000 prototype.

618
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,847
Why are you here, Q?

619
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:26,843
Oh, I just fancied a break, to be honest.

620
01:07:26,921 --> 01:07:28,998
I've been a tad stressed at work recently.

621
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:31,003
What with C's people crawling all over us

622
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:33,003
and the fact that M wants my balls
for Christmas decorations.

623
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:35,242
Get to the point.
The point, 007,

624
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,448
is that Franz Oberhauser is dead.

625
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:39,010
Dead and buried.

626
01:07:39,081 --> 01:07:40,412
And unless you come back
with me right now,

627
01:07:40,481 --> 01:07:43,405
my career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.

628
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:46,398
Do you understand? All hell is
breaking loose out there and...

629
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:49,131
I saw him.
You thought you saw him.

630
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,771
We've been through the records.

631
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,492
He died in an avalanche
with his father 20 years ago.

632
01:07:53,561 --> 01:07:55,528
Yes. I know that.

633
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:57,046
But I saw him.

634
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:01,088
He's not someone I'll ever forget.

635
01:08:02,561 --> 01:08:04,722
So you have a lead?

636
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,564
I have a name. <i>L'Américain.</i>

637
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,490
Well, that narrows it down.

638
01:08:09,601 --> 01:08:11,887
Look, I'm sorry, 007, but time's up.

639
01:08:11,961 --> 01:08:14,008
My whole career is on the line here.

640
01:08:14,081 --> 01:08:16,526
Either you come back in
and do this through proper channels,

641
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,726
or I go directly to M.

642
01:08:17,801 --> 01:08:20,485
Do one more thing for me.
Then you're out.

643
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,841
Find out what you can from this.

644
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,080
I really, really hate you right now.

645
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,690
Thank you, Q.

646
01:08:36,841 --> 01:08:38,968
<i>Monsieur?</i> Now? Please?

647
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:40,087
Where are you staying?

648
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,242
The Pevsner. Room 12.

649
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,560
One hour.

650
01:08:43,961 --> 01:08:47,443
Here you are, sir.
One prolytic digestive enzyme shake.

651
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:49,051
Do me a favor, will you?

652
01:08:49,121 --> 01:08:51,248
Throw that down the toilet.

653
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,766
Cut out the middleman.

654
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,565
No! Stay.

655
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,965
What do you want?

656
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,480
What are you doing?

657
01:10:02,121 --> 01:10:03,770
Can't any of you speak?

658
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,766
Come on!

659
01:14:30,961 --> 01:14:32,725
Argh, don't touch me!

660
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,561
Hey!

661
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:37,970
You need to take a breath and calm down.
You're in shock.

662
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:40,850
Get away from me! Just get away!

663
01:14:40,961 --> 01:14:43,361
Did it cross your mind
that you led them to me?

664
01:14:48,801 --> 01:14:50,201
I haven't got time for this.

665
01:14:50,881 --> 01:14:54,043
You need to tell me everything
you know about <i>L'Américain.</i>

666
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,572
Go to hell!

667
01:14:58,681 --> 01:15:00,364
I gave your father my word!

668
01:15:02,721 --> 01:15:06,042
And why should I trust you?
Because my father did?

669
01:15:06,841 --> 01:15:09,047
Because right now, Dr. Swann,

670
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:13,367
I'm your best chance of staying alive.

671
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:38,324
Dr. Swann, Q.

672
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,449
Q, Dr. Swann.

673
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,083
Hello. Enchanted.

674
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:47,810
Bond, we need to talk. Alone.

675
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:49,007
She knows.

676
01:15:49,081 --> 01:15:51,048
But, Bond... She knows.

677
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,007
What have you got?

678
01:15:53,761 --> 01:15:55,922
I owe you an apology, 007.

679
01:15:56,641 --> 01:15:58,642
You are onto something.

680
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,971
Oberhauser is still alive.
The ring proves it.

681
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,950
And it seems they were
all part of one organization.

682
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:09,447
Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra,
your friend Mr. Silva.

683
01:16:09,761 --> 01:16:11,489
And do you know who links them all?

684
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:12,766
Him.

685
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:14,372
Exactly.

686
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,887
This organization,
do you know what it's called?

687
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,447
- No.
- Spectre.

688
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,368
Its name is Spectre.

689
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:25,801
How does she know that?

690
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:28,122
Because my father was part of it.

691
01:16:29,081 --> 01:16:31,081
Then I think that you ought to see this.

692
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,846
<i>You're looking
at pictures from South Africa right now</i>

693
01:16:33,921 --> 01:16:35,889
<i>of what appears to be a huge explosion.</i>

694
01:16:35,961 --> 01:16:38,532
Q, go back to London.

695
01:16:39,841 --> 01:16:42,845
M's gonna need your help.
And keep tracking me.

696
01:16:42,921 --> 01:16:44,127
I will.

697
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,767
And, Bond, you have to find <i>L'Américain.</i>

698
01:16:47,801 --> 01:16:49,849
He's our only link to Oberhauser.

699
01:16:49,921 --> 01:16:51,252
It's not a person.

700
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,086
It's a place.

701
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,725
Thank you.

702
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,760
This is where they spent
their wedding night.

703
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,403
They came back every year.

704
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,209
Then they brought me with them, too.

705
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,610
He kept coming back,
even after the divorce.

706
01:18:49,961 --> 01:18:51,770
Well, then I'm sorry.

707
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:53,807
What for?

708
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,282
Ah-ha!

709
01:19:09,961 --> 01:19:11,292
What is it?

710
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,050
It's your inheritance.

711
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,887
Want some? No, thank you.

712
01:19:19,641 --> 01:19:22,121
You don't know what you're missing.

713
01:19:30,921 --> 01:19:32,605
This can't be it.

714
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:35,928
Well, here's to your father.

715
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,809
I promised myself I would never
be hurt by that man again.

716
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,329
I cut off all contact.

717
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:49,642
I didn't want anything to do
with him or his sick life.

718
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:53,162
And then, with his dying breath

719
01:19:53,841 --> 01:19:55,444
he sends me you.

720
01:19:56,801 --> 01:19:58,291
Ironic, no?

721
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,727
You shouldn't be so hard on him.

722
01:20:01,001 --> 01:20:04,209
The man I just met should
have been dead weeks ago.

723
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,046
The only reason his heart
was still beating was you.

724
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,011
I'll mourn my father
in my own time, Mr. Bond.

725
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,568
And, now, I'm going to bed.

726
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,761
Oh.

727
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:26,251
Don't think for one moment
this is where I fall into your arms,

728
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,091
seeking solace for my dead daddy.

729
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,725
You sit there.

730
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,204
Keep watch.
That's what you're good at.

731
01:20:44,001 --> 01:20:46,925
Come anywhere near me and I'll kill you.

732
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,650
I don't doubt it.

733
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,324
Look. There are two of you.

734
01:21:03,761 --> 01:21:05,331
Two Jameses.

735
01:21:06,721 --> 01:21:08,371
Lucky me.

736
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,761
What am I doing here?

737
01:21:23,681 --> 01:21:26,332
To liars...

738
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,368
and killers.

739
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,642
To liars...

740
01:21:30,721 --> 01:21:32,722
and killers...

741
01:21:32,801 --> 01:21:34,802
everywhere.

742
01:22:06,761 --> 01:22:08,604
Who sent you?

743
01:22:12,001 --> 01:22:13,730
Who are you working for?

744
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,408
Now, where did you go?

745
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,890
Of course.

746
01:24:47,081 --> 01:24:48,445
What is it?

747
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,611
Nothing.

748
01:25:07,081 --> 01:25:08,367
What's this?

749
01:25:09,001 --> 01:25:10,650
It's coordinates.

750
01:25:13,921 --> 01:25:16,492
Your father was scanning for
a particular satellite phone.

751
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,642
He was looking for someone.

752
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,283
He was looking for him.

753
01:25:23,921 --> 01:25:26,492
And he sent me here to finish the job.

754
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,404
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.

755
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,811
I like you alive.

756
01:25:32,881 --> 01:25:34,371
I can look after myself.

757
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,169
That's beside the point.

758
01:25:37,681 --> 01:25:39,284
I might not be coming back.

759
01:25:39,721 --> 01:25:40,926
I know.

760
01:25:41,881 --> 01:25:45,168
But I want to understand
what happened to my father.

761
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,523
So, where was he going?

762
01:26:09,041 --> 01:26:10,452
Nowhere.

763
01:26:22,921 --> 01:26:25,605
Thank you so much. Thanks.
All the very best.

764
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:26,681
What's going on?

765
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:28,644
The meeting was brought forward.
Did you not get the message?

766
01:26:28,721 --> 01:26:29,801
No, we didn't.

767
01:26:29,881 --> 01:26:31,277
Shortest meeting I can remember.

768
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,806
South Africans on board, I take it?

769
01:26:32,881 --> 01:26:34,724
Yeah, well, who can blame them?

770
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,368
Nine Eyes is now officially sanctioned.

771
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,011
The new system goes live
in less than 72 hours.

772
01:26:40,081 --> 01:26:42,048
It's a major step forward.

773
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:43,963
Global intelligence cooperation
changes everything.

774
01:26:44,041 --> 01:26:45,725
As you said before.

775
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,686
Look.

776
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,682
They've asked me
to head the new committee.

777
01:26:51,761 --> 01:26:53,650
Yes? And?

778
01:26:53,721 --> 01:26:57,328
And I should tell you
I've spoken with the Home Secretary.

779
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,166
And in light of the new information
I've given him,

780
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,678
he's decided to close down the
double-0 program with immediate effect.

781
01:27:03,761 --> 01:27:04,922
You don't know what you're doing.

782
01:27:05,001 --> 01:27:06,923
It's not personal.

783
01:27:07,001 --> 01:27:08,605
It's the future.

784
01:27:09,001 --> 01:27:10,287
And...

785
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:13,761
You're not.

786
01:27:13,801 --> 01:27:15,901
You're a cocky little bastard, aren't you?

787
01:27:17,921 --> 01:27:19,570
I'll take that as a compliment.

788
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:21,172
I wouldn't.

789
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,930
This isn't over yet.

790
01:27:41,921 --> 01:27:45,163
Would you press this for me? Thank you.
Yes, sir.

791
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,685
Pick it up.

792
01:28:06,961 --> 01:28:08,325
I hate guns.

793
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:11,127
I promised him I'd protect you.

794
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:14,237
The first thing to do is to teach
you how to protect yourself.

795
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,323
What if I shoot you by mistake?

796
01:28:16,681 --> 01:28:18,809
Wouldn't be the first time.

797
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,400
Pick it up.

798
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,404
I said, I hate guns.

799
01:28:28,081 --> 01:28:29,765
SIG 226.

800
01:28:30,041 --> 01:28:32,691
Front sight. Rear sight. Hammer.

801
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,721
You just point it.
You squeeze the trigger.

802
01:28:40,801 --> 01:28:43,042
You try not to close your eyes.

803
01:28:43,681 --> 01:28:46,365
Please, try it.

804
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:14,212
I don't have to teach you anything, do I?

805
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:19,324
A man once came to our house
to kill my father.

806
01:29:19,961 --> 01:29:23,169
He didn't know I was upstairs
playing in my bedroom.

807
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,528
Or that Papa kept
a Beretta Nine-millimeter

808
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,762
under the sink with the bleach.

809
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:33,003
That's why I hate guns.

810
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,966
I think we'll skip hand-to-hand combat.

811
01:29:54,921 --> 01:29:56,002
Good evening, sir.

812
01:29:56,081 --> 01:29:58,208
Sorry to interrupt your supper,
but we have some news.

813
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,725
Evening, sir.

814
01:29:59,801 --> 01:30:02,280
Using the Smart Blood, I've tracked Bond

815
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,886
to a point here in North Africa.

816
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,811
See, every known map
registers it as empty desert.

817
01:30:08,881 --> 01:30:12,726
Exactly. But if you look at the satellite
blowup, you can clearly see this.

818
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:14,412
We can't help him.

819
01:30:15,801 --> 01:30:17,651
But, sir, we know where he's heading.

820
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,130
C is watching everything we do.

821
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,806
We're only handing them more information.

822
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:29,408
Sir, we can't just desert Bond.

823
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,569
We have to.
We only make him weaker.

824
01:30:31,641 --> 01:30:33,211
But, sir, we know exactly where he is.

825
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,931
Yes, I know, but if we can track him,
so can others.

826
01:30:36,761 --> 01:30:39,047
Delete all the Smart Blood files.

827
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:40,282
Everything.

828
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,805
He's on his own.

829
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,492
You shouldn't stare.

830
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,484
Well, you shouldn't look like that.

831
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,444
May I get you an <i>apéritif?</i>

832
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,806
I'm not sure.

833
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:23,963
It gets me into trouble.
Makes me do crazy things.

834
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:25,610
Well, we can't have that.

835
01:31:25,961 --> 01:31:29,488
So, I'll have a vodka martini, dirty.

836
01:31:29,801 --> 01:31:31,325
Make that two.

837
01:31:34,841 --> 01:31:36,331
I have a question.

838
01:31:36,641 --> 01:31:37,881
Well, what's that?

839
01:31:37,961 --> 01:31:40,850
Why, given every other possible option,

840
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,681
does a man choose the life
of a paid assassin?

841
01:31:43,761 --> 01:31:45,729
Well, it was that or the priesthood.

842
01:31:47,881 --> 01:31:51,043
I'm serious.
Is this really what you want?

843
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:54,966
Living in the shadows?
Hunting? Being hunted?

844
01:31:55,721 --> 01:31:58,690
Always looking behind you?
Always alone?

845
01:31:59,041 --> 01:32:00,327
But I'm not alone.

846
01:32:01,081 --> 01:32:02,765
Answer the question.

847
01:32:03,881 --> 01:32:06,360
I'm not sure I ever had a choice.

848
01:32:07,721 --> 01:32:09,802
Anyway, I don't stop to think about it.

849
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:12,043
What would happen if you did?

850
01:32:12,841 --> 01:32:15,287
Stop? Yes.

851
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,691
I don't know.

852
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,011
Your drinks, sir.

853
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:25,560
Could you leave them there, please.

854
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:39,202
You know, I think you're wrong.

855
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,645
I am?

856
01:32:41,921 --> 01:32:43,889
We always have a choice.

857
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,329
I'll drink to that.

858
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,401
Shit.

859
01:35:45,801 --> 01:35:47,484
What do we do now?

860
01:36:46,921 --> 01:36:48,685
This might be a long wait.

861
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,488
Are you having second thoughts?

862
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:55,530
Too late now.

863
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:16,525
What's that?

864
01:37:31,881 --> 01:37:36,569
That is a 1948 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith.

865
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:01,887
Please.

866
01:38:24,921 --> 01:38:26,730
I'm scared, James.

867
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:13,246
Good afternoon,
Mr. Bond, Dr. Swann.

868
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:17,320
I want you to know just how excited
we all are to finally meet you.

869
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:20,166
Well, it's a pleasure to be here.

870
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,881
Your host invites you both to rest,

871
01:39:22,961 --> 01:39:25,361
relax, and join him
for drinks at 4:00.

872
01:39:25,761 --> 01:39:28,011
- Tell our host we won't be late.
- Wonderful.

873
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,086
Before we show you to your rooms,
just one more thing.

874
01:39:38,841 --> 01:39:40,002
Oh.

875
01:39:42,761 --> 01:39:44,444
You be careful with that.

876
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:46,810
It's loaded.

877
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,691
Thank you.

878
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:56,087
This is a very special place.

879
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:59,922
He has requested you enter it alone.

880
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:01,771
Of course.

881
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:05,611
Champagne?

882
01:41:06,921 --> 01:41:08,365
Maybe later.

883
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:10,405
Certainly.

884
01:41:41,801 --> 01:41:44,372
I think we're meant to be impressed.

885
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,520
Touch it.

886
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,408
You can touch it if you want.

887
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,409
Do you know what it is?

888
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,164
It's a meteorite.

889
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,010
Yes, exactly.

890
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:15,280
The Kartenhoff.
The oldest in human possession.

891
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:19,284
The very meteorite which made this crater.

892
01:42:21,121 --> 01:42:22,360
Think about it.

893
01:42:23,001 --> 01:42:26,641
So many years up there, alone, silent,

894
01:42:27,801 --> 01:42:31,725
building momentum until it chose
to make its mark on Earth.

895
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,252
A huge, unstoppable force.

896
01:42:36,801 --> 01:42:39,167
Except it did stop, didn't it?

897
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:41,051
Right here.

898
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:59,327
I can't tell you how much I've been
looking forward to this.

899
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,721
All of us here, together.

900
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,046
A reunion.

901
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,044
I'm so glad you came, too, dear Madeleine.

902
01:43:12,841 --> 01:43:15,685
You were just a girl when I saw you first.

903
01:43:17,081 --> 01:43:20,051
I came to your home once
to see your father.

904
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,244
I don't remember that.

905
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,931
But I do.

906
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:32,801
Shall we?

907
01:43:36,761 --> 01:43:38,001
What is this place?

908
01:43:38,761 --> 01:43:40,172
Information.

909
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,169
Information is all,

910
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:47,811
is it not?

911
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:50,485
For example,

912
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:55,168
you must know by now that
the double-0 program is officially dead.

913
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:59,605
Which leads me to
speculate exactly why you came.

914
01:44:02,881 --> 01:44:05,770
So, James, why did you come?

915
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,965
I came here to kill you.

916
01:44:08,961 --> 01:44:11,282
And I thought you came here to die.

917
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,649
Well, it's all a matter of perspective.

918
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,169
Speaking of perspective.

919
01:44:34,961 --> 01:44:38,328
- Is this live?
- Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.

920
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,841
What an uncanny coincidence.

921
01:44:41,921 --> 01:44:46,404
<i>The French have a saying,
"It's the fate of glass to break."</i>

922
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:50,565
<i>Well, maybe it's the fate of spies
to just disappear.</i>

923
01:44:50,801 --> 01:44:52,484
<i>But with any luck,</i>

924
01:44:52,841 --> 01:44:54,889
<i>we leave something behind.</i>

925
01:44:55,121 --> 01:44:58,648
<i>In the meantime,
I'm sure C will keep you all busy.</i>

926
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,011
<i>Thank you all.</i>

927
01:45:04,801 --> 01:45:07,645
That's touching, don't you think?

928
01:45:10,801 --> 01:45:12,484
Well, James,

929
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,448
it looks like you're all alone.

930
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,172
Not much more than a voyeur, are you?

931
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,203
Too scared to join in.

932
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,124
I don't think you quite understand.

933
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,611
Oh, I think I do.

934
01:45:24,681 --> 01:45:27,445
You set cities on fire and watch
innocent people burn,

935
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,727
so you can convince governments to join

936
01:45:29,801 --> 01:45:32,452
an intelligence network you've paid for.

937
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,364
Not that complicated.

938
01:45:35,081 --> 01:45:38,881
I'm guessing our little friend, C,
he's one of your disciples.

939
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,050
You could say that.

940
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,845
And what does he get out of it?

941
01:45:44,841 --> 01:45:46,047
Nothing.

942
01:45:46,681 --> 01:45:48,489
He's a visionary, like me.

943
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,211
Visionaries.

944
01:45:51,001 --> 01:45:52,890
Psychiatric wards are full of them.

945
01:45:53,001 --> 01:45:55,925
Whereas you couldn't see
what's right in front of you.

946
01:45:56,001 --> 01:46:00,006
You came across me so many times
and yet you never saw me.

947
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,962
Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva.

948
01:46:03,081 --> 01:46:04,207
All dead.

949
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:05,407
Yeah, that's right.

950
01:46:05,681 --> 01:46:07,171
A nice pattern developed.

951
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:10,688
You interfered in my world,
I destroyed yours.

952
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,164
Or did you think it was coincidence

953
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,811
that all the women in
your life ended up dead?

954
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,323
Vesper Lynd, for example.

955
01:46:21,801 --> 01:46:25,203
She was the big one.
Has he told you about her?

956
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:30,724
And then, of course, your beloved M.

957
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,602
Gone forever.

958
01:46:37,721 --> 01:46:38,882
Me.

959
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:42,842
It was all me, James.

960
01:46:42,921 --> 01:46:46,721
It's always been me.
The author of all your pain.

961
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,962
You're a brave woman, my dear.

962
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:03,444
Now I understand why
my father lost his mind.

963
01:47:03,801 --> 01:47:06,690
He didn't lose his mind, he was just weak.

964
01:47:06,761 --> 01:47:09,038
But at least he understood
what he was up against.

965
01:47:09,121 --> 01:47:12,329
You see, they failed
to comprehend the crucial fact,

966
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:16,127
that a terrible event
can lead to something wonderful.

967
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,680
Since you mention your father,
I'll show you.

968
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:24,007
<i>She's clever. She's smarter than me.</i>

969
01:47:24,081 --> 01:47:25,320
<i>She knows how to hide.</i>

970
01:47:27,641 --> 01:47:30,565
<i>I can protect her
if you tell me where he is.</i>

971
01:47:32,961 --> 01:47:34,610
<i>I can keep her alive.</i>

972
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:35,921
<i>Yeah.</i>

973
01:47:36,001 --> 01:47:37,207
<i>You have my word.</i>

974
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,248
No, no, no. Turn this off.

975
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,925
<i>Your word?</i>

976
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,926
<i>The word of an assassin!</i>

977
01:47:43,001 --> 01:47:44,332
Turn this off.

978
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,483
This is important.
I said turn it off!

979
01:47:49,121 --> 01:47:51,646
I want you to understand something.

980
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:03,204
<i>That's my word.</i>

981
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,606
Madeleine?

982
01:48:06,121 --> 01:48:07,532
Look at me.

983
01:48:08,681 --> 01:48:12,127
Don't look at him,
Madeleine. Look at me.

984
01:48:14,001 --> 01:48:15,490
<i>L'Américain.</i>

985
01:48:16,681 --> 01:48:18,251
<i>You save her,</i>

986
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:21,684
<i>she can lead you to L'Américain.
She knows L'Américain.</i>

987
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,529
<i>Try the Hoffler Klinik.</i>

988
01:48:33,041 --> 01:48:37,409
<i>You're a kite dancing in a hurricane,
Mr. Bond.</i>

989
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,891
<i>So long.</i>

990
01:48:49,041 --> 01:48:52,408
The things that bring people together.

991
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:59,011
Out of horror, beauty.

992
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:28,371
Torture is easy, on a superficial level.

993
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:31,569
A man can watch himself being disemboweled

994
01:49:32,081 --> 01:49:35,243
and derive great horror
from the experience,

995
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,971
but it's still going on at a distance.

996
01:49:38,121 --> 01:49:40,886
It isn't taking place where he is.

997
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:47,289
As you know all too well, dear Madeleine,
a man lives inside his head.

998
01:49:47,761 --> 01:49:50,525
That's where the seat of his soul is.

999
01:49:51,881 --> 01:49:54,327
Now, James and I were
both present recently

1000
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,926
when a man was deprived of his eyes.

1001
01:49:57,921 --> 01:50:01,208
And the most astonishing thing happened.

1002
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:02,441
Didn't you notice?

1003
01:50:02,961 --> 01:50:05,123
He wasn't there anymore.

1004
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:07,847
He'd gone even though he was still alive.

1005
01:50:07,921 --> 01:50:11,811
So in this brief moment
between life and death,

1006
01:50:11,881 --> 01:50:14,725
there was nobody inside his skull.

1007
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:17,611
Most odd.

1008
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:20,931
So, James.

1009
01:50:22,841 --> 01:50:25,650
I'm going to penetrate

1010
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:28,841
to where you are.

1011
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,841
To the inside of your head.

1012
01:50:32,921 --> 01:50:35,685
Now, the first probe
will play with your sight,

1013
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:37,167
your hearing

1014
01:50:37,801 --> 01:50:39,928
and your balance,

1015
01:50:40,001 --> 01:50:42,845
just with the subtlest of manipulations.

1016
01:50:43,001 --> 01:50:45,048
Well, get on with it then.

1017
01:50:45,681 --> 01:50:49,002
Nothing can be as painful
as listening to you talk.

1018
01:50:49,801 --> 01:50:51,166
All right.

1019
01:50:51,921 --> 01:50:53,365
Let's begin.

1020
01:51:26,001 --> 01:51:28,002
Why are you doing this?

1021
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,328
You probably know that James here

1022
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:45,529
lost his parents when he was young.

1023
01:51:48,881 --> 01:51:51,327
But did you know that it was my father

1024
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,801
who helped him
through this difficult time?

1025
01:52:01,961 --> 01:52:03,962
Over the course of two winters

1026
01:52:04,041 --> 01:52:08,251
he taught him to ski, and climb, and hunt.

1027
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:13,444
He soothed the wounds
of the poor little blue-eyed orphan.

1028
01:52:16,081 --> 01:52:18,766
Asked me to treat him as a brother.

1029
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,044
My little brother.

1030
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:24,602
They formed quite an attachment.

1031
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:27,407
So,

1032
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:29,447
you killed him.

1033
01:52:30,961 --> 01:52:32,450
Yes, I did.

1034
01:52:35,961 --> 01:52:38,645
You know what happens when a cuckoo

1035
01:52:38,721 --> 01:52:41,645
hatches inside another bird's nest?

1036
01:52:42,921 --> 01:52:44,082
Yes.

1037
01:52:45,121 --> 01:52:47,566
It forces the other eggs out.

1038
01:52:47,641 --> 01:52:48,688
Yes.

1039
01:52:48,961 --> 01:52:53,966
Well, this cuckoo made me realize
my father's life had to end.

1040
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:57,891
In a way, he's responsible
for the path I took.

1041
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:00,811
- So, thank you.
- Cuckoo.

1042
01:53:06,641 --> 01:53:09,565
Do you know any other birdcalls, Franz?

1043
01:53:17,121 --> 01:53:18,452
Hello, pussy.

1044
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:24,767
Franz Oberhauser died 20 years ago, James.

1045
01:53:24,841 --> 01:53:27,605
In an avalanche, alongside his father.

1046
01:53:28,841 --> 01:53:33,289
The man you are talking to now,
the man inside your head,

1047
01:53:34,001 --> 01:53:36,606
is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

1048
01:53:37,001 --> 01:53:38,490
Catchy name.

1049
01:53:39,001 --> 01:53:41,002
My mother's bloodline.

1050
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:46,690
If the needle finds the correct spot
in the fusiform gyrus,

1051
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:49,203
you'll recognize no one.

1052
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,091
Of course, the faces of your women

1053
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:53,160
are interchangeable, aren't they, James?

1054
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,805
You won't know who she is.

1055
01:53:56,881 --> 01:54:00,123
Just another passing face
on your way to the grave.

1056
01:54:08,841 --> 01:54:11,572
He dies not knowing who you are.

1057
01:54:13,841 --> 01:54:15,730
The daughter of an assassin.

1058
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:18,460
The only one
who could have understood him.

1059
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,886
Shame.

1060
01:54:57,801 --> 01:54:59,291
I love you.

1061
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,041
Do those blue eyes still recognize you?

1062
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,251
I'd recognize you anywhere.

1063
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,846
The watch.

1064
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,691
One minute.

1065
01:55:36,121 --> 01:55:37,610
One minute.

1066
01:55:41,641 --> 01:55:43,404
Did he say something?

1067
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:44,811
<i>Tempus fugit.</i>

1068
01:55:46,641 --> 01:55:49,325
- What?
<i>- Tempus fugit.</i>

1069
01:55:49,801 --> 01:55:51,802
I can't hear you, James.

1070
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:55,532
I said,

1071
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,163
doesn't time fly?

1072
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:26,811
In there!

1073
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,891
Let's go home.

1074
01:57:26,081 --> 01:57:27,765
It's not over yet.

1075
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,171
I've never even heard of Hildebrand.

1076
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:22,484
That is the general idea with safe houses.

1077
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,091
Exactly how safe is this, sir?

1078
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:43,003
We're about to find out.

1079
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:47,931
It's safe.

1080
01:58:48,001 --> 01:58:49,650
Better wait here.

1081
01:58:53,121 --> 01:58:54,247
I'm M.

1082
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:55,368
Madeleine Swann.

1083
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:56,440
Pleased to meet you.

1084
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,324
So, what do you have for me, 007?

1085
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:02,485
The recently deceased head of Spectre,
Ernst Stavro Blofeld,

1086
01:59:03,121 --> 01:59:06,966
and his chief of intelligence,
your new best friend, C.

1087
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:11,364
About to take control of his
very own global surveillance system

1088
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:13,921
that he built right here under our noses.

1089
01:59:14,001 --> 01:59:16,758
Then we'd better move.
The system goes online at midnight.

1090
01:59:16,841 --> 01:59:19,730
If that happens,
Spectre will have control of everything.

1091
01:59:19,801 --> 01:59:21,769
So, you and I will
have a quiet word with C

1092
01:59:21,841 --> 01:59:24,591
while Q hacks into the system
and stops it going online.

1093
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:26,162
It won't be easy.

1094
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:28,641
He'll find a way.
He always does.

1095
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:35,329
It's good to have you back, 007.

1096
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,282
Sir.

1097
01:59:46,881 --> 01:59:48,724
James, I can't.

1098
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:52,404
I'll come back for you when it's all over.

1099
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:54,971
No, I can't.

1100
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:57,403
No, you can't stay here, or you...

1101
01:59:58,081 --> 02:00:02,291
I can't go back to this life.
And I'm not going to ask you to change.

1102
02:00:03,001 --> 02:00:04,490
This is who you are.

1103
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:08,810
You're saying good-bye.

1104
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:10,686
Yes.

1105
02:00:12,881 --> 02:00:14,212
Take care.

1106
02:00:16,641 --> 02:00:18,642
You're a good man, James.

1107
02:01:19,801 --> 02:01:21,371
Are you in yet, Q?

1108
02:01:21,801 --> 02:01:24,122
A few layers of impenetrable
security still to go,

1109
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:26,168
<i>but I think I'm getting somewhere.</i>

1110
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:16,171
They've seen us! Reverse!

1111
02:02:56,081 --> 02:02:57,242
Go!

1112
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:10,248
Get him in the building!

1113
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:12,568
Move. Move!

1114
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:35,047
Go back and find M, now!
We need them both.

1115
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:47,364
Not a good feeling being watched, is it?

1116
02:04:52,041 --> 02:04:53,963
Don't tell me you're responsible for this.

1117
02:04:54,041 --> 02:04:56,931
No, but my Quartermaster is.

1118
02:04:57,001 --> 02:04:58,730
And he's extremely talented.

1119
02:04:58,841 --> 02:04:59,887
Well, bravo.

1120
02:04:59,961 --> 02:05:04,364
But in case you hadn't realized it,
you two are out of a job.

1121
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:05,681
So you're trespassing.

1122
02:05:05,761 --> 02:05:08,207
I'm afraid you've got
the wrong end of the stick, Max.

1123
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:11,046
We're going to
stop this system going online.

1124
02:05:11,121 --> 02:05:12,558
And then I'm going to bring you in.

1125
02:05:12,641 --> 02:05:14,166
On what grounds exactly?

1126
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:16,369
Poor taste in friends.

1127
02:05:52,721 --> 02:05:55,122
Take a look at the world.

1128
02:05:56,721 --> 02:05:57,882
Chaos.

1129
02:05:59,001 --> 02:06:00,923
Because people like you,

1130
02:06:01,001 --> 02:06:02,477
paper-pushers and politicians,

1131
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:06,087
are too spineless to do
what needs to be done.

1132
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:10,007
So I made an alliance to put
the power where it should be.

1133
02:06:10,081 --> 02:06:15,121
And now you want to throw
it away for the sake of "democracy."

1134
02:06:15,721 --> 02:06:17,404
Whatever the hell that is.

1135
02:06:17,961 --> 02:06:20,532
How predictably moronic.

1136
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:23,968
But then isn't that what M stands for?

1137
02:06:25,801 --> 02:06:27,769
"Moron."

1138
02:06:28,841 --> 02:06:31,162
And now we know what C stands for.

1139
02:06:35,801 --> 02:06:37,132
"Careless."

1140
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:18,051
Come on.

1141
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:19,925
No, no, no!

1142
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:27,489
You're a hard man to kill, Blofeld.

1143
02:08:33,921 --> 02:08:36,083
Ouch.

1144
02:08:36,681 --> 02:08:38,531
I do hope that doesn't hurt too much.

1145
02:08:39,721 --> 02:08:43,167
My wounds will heal.

1146
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:44,891
What about yours?

1147
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:48,761
Look around you, James. Look.

1148
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:51,408
This is what's left of your world.

1149
02:08:51,681 --> 02:08:55,891
Everything you ever stood for,
everything you believed in, a ruin.

1150
02:08:57,041 --> 02:08:59,566
Why are we here?

1151
02:09:00,801 --> 02:09:02,565
Did you miss me?

1152
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:04,726
No.

1153
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:14,444
But I know someone who does.

1154
02:09:21,641 --> 02:09:23,722
Where is she?

1155
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:26,966
That's for you to find out.

1156
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:37,484
In three minutes,
this building will be demolished.

1157
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,801
I can get out easily.

1158
02:09:40,881 --> 02:09:42,928
Now, you have a choice.

1159
02:09:43,041 --> 02:09:45,566
Die trying to save her or

1160
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:48,042
save yourself and live with the pain.

1161
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:50,327
You're bluffing.

1162
02:09:52,921 --> 02:09:54,002
Am I?

1163
02:10:01,681 --> 02:10:03,801
I've really put you through it, haven't I?

1164
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:06,850
That's brothers for you.

1165
02:10:07,841 --> 02:10:11,288
They always know which buttons to press.

1166
02:10:23,681 --> 02:10:25,729
Madeleine!

1167
02:10:31,001 --> 02:10:32,730
Come on.

1168
02:10:33,121 --> 02:10:34,122
Come on.

1169
02:10:35,641 --> 02:10:37,131
Yes!

1170
02:10:38,761 --> 02:10:40,126
Let's go.

1171
02:10:40,841 --> 02:10:41,841
After you.

1172
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:55,529
Why can't you just face it, M?

1173
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:58,046
You don't matter anymore.

1174
02:10:58,881 --> 02:11:00,962
Maybe I don't.

1175
02:11:01,041 --> 02:11:02,247
But something has to.

1176
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:58,202
Dead.

1177
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,811
- Any word on Bond?
- No.

1178
02:11:59,961 --> 02:12:01,803
But I can hazard a guess.

1179
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:11,642
Madeleine!

1180
02:12:13,841 --> 02:12:15,889
Madeleine!

1181
02:13:00,681 --> 02:13:01,806
Do you trust me?

1182
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:03,287
Do I have a choice?

1183
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:04,361
Not anymore.

1184
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:16,532
Come on!

1185
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:33,449
Good-bye, James Bond.

1186
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:37,730
Brace, brace, brace!

1187
02:16:45,561 --> 02:16:46,837
Sir, this is a terrorist alert.

1188
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:48,220
Mallory, double-0 section.

1189
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:53,329
Stand them down.

1190
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:56,250
Echo team, hold fire.

1191
02:16:56,561 --> 02:16:58,848
Stand down.

1192
02:17:34,321 --> 02:17:35,446
Finish it.

1193
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,730
Finish it.

1194
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:02,725
Out of bullets.

1195
02:18:19,641 --> 02:18:21,688
And besides,

1196
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,002
I've got something better to do.

1197
02:19:10,481 --> 02:19:12,643
Under the Special Measures Act of 2001,

1198
02:19:12,721 --> 02:19:15,644
I am detaining you on behalf of
Her Majesty's Government.

1199
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:23,046
Bond?

1200
02:20:28,121 --> 02:20:30,123
What are you doing here?
Good morning, Q.

1201
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,206
I thought you'd gone.

1202
02:20:39,321 --> 02:20:40,446
I have.

1203
02:20:42,321 --> 02:20:44,562
There's just one thing I need.

1
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:06,772
When I was young,
I thought house painters painted houses.

2
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:10,318
What did I know?

3
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:12,278
I was a working guy.

4
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:16,198
A business agent for Teamster Local 107

5
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:17,742
out of South Philly.

6
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:20,369
One of a thousand working stiffs...

7
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,749
until I wasn't no more.

8
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:27,793
And then...

9
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:30,838
I started painting houses...

10
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:34,091
myself.

11
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:51,401
In this particular matter,

12
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:54,028
the whole thing was built
around the wedding.

13
00:02:56,906 --> 00:03:00,576
Bill Bufalino's daughter
was getting married in Detroit.

14
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,787
Bill was a Teamster lawyer,
but more important,

15
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,830
he was Russell Bufalino's cousin.

16
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:08,667
Now, Russell didn't want to fly,

17
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:11,879
so I was gonna drive him to the wedding.

18
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:14,841
<i>He wanted to take care of
some business along the way,</i>

19
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:17,927
which in Russell's case
meant only one thing:

20
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,388
Money... collecting it.

21
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,889
So we'd drive.

22
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:25,101
Him and his wife Carrie
and me and my wife Irene.

23
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:27,019
Or I call her Reenie.

24
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:32,066
I figured we would take 476 out of Philly,

25
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,651
and then we go up to Pittston

26
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,903
and pick up Russ,
which is usually how we did it,

27
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:39,657
and then Interstate 80 West

28
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,326
through the rest of Pennsylvania,

29
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,121
and then we'd go across Ohio,
all the way to Toledo,

30
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:48,749
and then we would go 75 North to Detroit.

31
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:54,422
It was gonna take about three days

32
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:57,633
with all the business breaks
and cigarette stops,

33
00:03:57,716 --> 00:04:00,886
since Russell didn't allow
nobody to smoke in the car.

34
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,764
He says Jimmy Blue Eyes and Meyer Lansky

35
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:06,601
convinced him to stop smoking
when they were getting kicked out

36
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:09,728
of their casinos in Cuba
and getting shot at by Castro.

37
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,440
I don't know.
It might have been one of those,

38
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:15,818
"Please, God, if I ever get out
of this fucking thing alive,

39
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,820
I'll never smoke again” things too.

40
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:20,990
But I do know that from Castro on,

41
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:23,409
Russ wouldn't allow
nobody to smoke in his car,

42
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:24,869
not even Carrie.

43
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,306
Can we stop soon?

44
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:50,311
We're only in the car two minutes, honey.

45
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,313
We're not even near the highway.

46
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:55,357
I know, Russell.
But you don't like to stop on the highway.

47
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:57,651
Well, it's not that so much.

48
00:04:57,735 --> 00:05:00,237
They don't let you stop on the highway.

49
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:03,574
Okay, so then we'll smoke in the car.

50
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,285
And what about my cataracts?

51
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:09,830
I'll crack the window.

52
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,628
Carrie, I made a vow.
Remember?

53
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:17,130
Remember I made a vow, Carrie?

54
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,632
Yeah, now I can't smoke on...

55
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,134
All right, and now I can't smoke.

56
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,821
See where we are?

57
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:49,328
Is... Is that...

58
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:52,498
What are those odds?

59
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,437
What's the problem, kid?

60
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:02,818
I don't... I don't know. It sounds funny.

61
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,237
It stops, it starts, it loses power.

62
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:08,414
Let me see if I can give you a hand.

63
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:13,871
Let me see.
Check all these plugs.

64
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:16,373
Spark plugs are okay.

65
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:19,335
The distributor cap's okay.

66
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:20,419
Good.

67
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:22,755
It's gotta be something with...
with this.

68
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:25,132
Timing chain.

69
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:28,344
This is what this is. There's a cap on it.

70
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:31,055
This cap is loose.
It ain't supposed to be loose.

71
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:34,058
So that means they're getting worn out.

72
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:35,225
You just gotta...

73
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:37,811
Try that now. Tighten it up.

74
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:46,070
I can drive 'em. I can't fix 'em.

75
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:47,863
You're back in business, kid.

76
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:49,156
Thanks.

77
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,826
- I owe you anything?
- No.

78
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,828
No, you don't owe me anything.

79
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:55,913
Thanks.

80
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:58,499
- Frank.
- Hey, Frank. How ya doing?

81
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:02,378
What's your name?

82
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:07,132
Where you from?

83
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,927
- Philly.
- You're from Philly.

84
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,053
Yeah.

85
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:14,473
Where you hang out there?

86
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,225
Callahan's.

87
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,895
Bocce Club. But it's a bar,
it's not a bocce club.

88
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,356
Yeah. You play bocce?

89
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,566
Nah.

90
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,569
All right, Frankie... get that fixed.

91
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:29,130
Because it'll go again on you,
I'm telling you.

92
00:08:29,154 --> 00:08:30,156
- Thank you.
- All right.

93
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:32,339
- I will. Thanks again.
- Good luck, buddy.

94
00:08:34,785 --> 00:08:37,705
I mean,
I thought maybe he owned the gas station.

95
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:40,082
'Cause he owned something, you could tell.

96
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:42,265
Yeah, it turns out
he owned the whole road.

97
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,936
J You went away and left me
Long time ago J

98
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:04,773
This one?

99
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,070
Salute! Drink up, fellas.

100
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,613
God bless.

101
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:14,047
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's make some money today.

102
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:16,702
It's a bar.

103
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:17,995
Say hello to your wife?

104
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:22,499
I got a way you can earn,
to push those hindquarters.

105
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,086
There's a guy in here,
he'll pay a lot of money for them.

106
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:28,169
Come on, let's shoot this first
and then we'll talk business.

107
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,550
At the other end of the bar,
at twelve o'clock...

108
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,427
You see him?
He's got a rescinding hairline.

109
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,113
Yeah, you'll make a lot of money with him.

110
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:37,890
See him there?
Skinny Razor. He owns the place.

111
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:38,974
Razor?

112
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:41,310
He shylocks
and runs a little book out of the joint.

113
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:43,743
He's got a lot of good action,
good connections.

114
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:47,279
- Razor's his name?
- Yeah, he used to work at a butcher shop.

115
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:53,363
My friend Frank Irish is here.
The one I told you about?

116
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:58,327
- The truck.
- Yeah, hindquarters.

117
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:00,037
Frank Sheeran.

118
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:02,956
You like steak?

119
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,250
I do.

120
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:06,627
I deliver steak.

121
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:08,420
Do ya?

122
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:09,588
Good steak.

123
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:12,090
I could deliver you steak.

124
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:17,262
- Could ya?
- I could.

125
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:20,724
Good price too. The best.

126
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:24,394
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.

127
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:25,479
Thanks, Skinny.

128
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:31,318
It's freezing out there.

129
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:32,945
I don't mind it.

130
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,154
Not me. I hate it.

131
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:37,414
Hey, do me a favor.
When you go outside...

132
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:39,451
put the seal on for me.

133
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,499
- All right. I gotta go out anyway.
- I owe you one.

134
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:50,337
J You'd better go back
To your used-to-be &

135
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:56,134
J Because your love's no good to me &

136
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:58,470
J I hear you knocking &

137
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:03,725
J But you can't come in &

138
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:10,148
J I hear you knocking &

139
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:15,028
J Go back where you've been &

140
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:46,101
J They call, they call me the fat man

141
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,688
J Cause I weigh two hundred pounds... ¢

142
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:51,106
There you go, Frank.

143
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:54,324
- See you next time.
- All right, Tony. Thanks.

144
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:57,738
Much better, Frank.

145
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:01,867
I don't go near Choice.
I only do Prime. That's it.

146
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,800
Can I get some more for next Tuesday?

147
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:05,037
How many you want?

148
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,831
At least five.

149
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,585
Okay. Five, you got.

150
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:24,139
- Amen.
- Amen.

151
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:33,774
What the fuck is this?

152
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:36,276
Tony, I don't...

153
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:39,005
- What the fuck is this, Frank?
- I don't... I don't know.

154
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:41,073
I mean...

155
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,408
I don't load the truck.

156
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:45,094
The loaders
are supposed to load the truck.

157
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:46,763
Maybe they didn't do their work.
I don't know.

158
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:48,789
You didn't realize you were
driving a light horse?

159
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:50,832
No. I just... Nothing. It felt fine.

160
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,793
Come on, Frank. Come on.

161
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:55,253
I'm telling you. I...

162
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:58,090
God's truth.
I just don't know what happened.

163
00:12:58,173 --> 00:12:59,800
I don't know. Maybe some...

164
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,347
- It's empty.
- I know it is.

165
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,849
I know it is.

166
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:11,561
What are you guys looking at?
Go back to work.

167
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:12,646
All of youse!

168
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:16,108
What can I tell the boss?

169
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:18,086
Well, I'm telling you
that I don't know what's going on.

170
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,820
Just don't look at me
'cause I, you know...

171
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:22,865
Well, who else can I look at?
This is not gonna be on me, Frank.

172
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:23,991
I'm telling you right now.

173
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:25,635
Me, I just drive the truck.
That's all I do.

174
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:28,036
Okay, Frank Sheeran.
Am I saying that right?

175
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,538
Yeah, you said right.

176
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:33,000
Under the contract,
thanks to Jimmy Hoffa...

177
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,901
management can only fire a driver
on very specific charges.

178
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:39,965
- So, you ever show up late?
- No.

179
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:41,800
- Do you have any moving violations?
- No.

180
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:43,635
- Do you drink on the job?
- No.

181
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,970
You ever hit anybody?

182
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:46,513
- On the job?
- Yeah.

183
00:13:46,596 --> 00:13:48,223
- No.
- Okay.

184
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:50,765
What about stealing, that ain't grounds?

185
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,102
Well...

186
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,104
can they prove it?

187
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,481
I don't think so.

188
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:59,165
All right then, we don't have
nothing to worry about.

189
00:14:01,236 --> 00:14:02,404
If they can prove it,

190
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:05,574
they're just gonna want names from you.
Accomplices.

191
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:08,327
That's all. You give them
a couple of names, you go home.

192
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,411
Keep your job.

193
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,538
What do you think about that?

194
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:14,583
- Would you give them names?
- No. No names.

195
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:20,881
You know, I don't...

196
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:22,914
I don't care whether you did it or not.

197
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:24,331
That makes no difference to me.

198
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:26,928
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm here to defend you. Right?

199
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:28,388
Right.

200
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,620
What, you want to know if I did it or not?

201
00:14:34,644 --> 00:14:36,688
'Well...

202
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:39,108
I'm gonna defend you either way.

203
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:40,400
Yeah, all right, but...

204
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:46,865
I, I work hard for them
when I ain't stealing from 'em.

205
00:14:49,034 --> 00:14:51,745
Your Honor,
if this was about right or wrong,

206
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:54,248
the company would have
sought Mr. Sheeran"s dismissal.

207
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:55,332
They didn't.

208
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:57,042
They only accused Mr. Sheeran

209
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,461
because the company hoped
he could name conspirators,

210
00:14:59,544 --> 00:15:02,714
which he couldn't do
because they don't exist.

211
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:05,550
They don't exist
because he didn't steal anything.

212
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:09,179
He didn't steal anything
because he's an exemplary employee,

213
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:12,599
who in eight years
has never taken a day of sick leave.

214
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,310
The only rule he ever broke
is his own union's,

215
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:18,647
by helping others
carry sides of beef from his truck

216
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,483
to their refrigerators
in the dead of winter.

217
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:25,529
All rise.

218
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:26,613
Court is in session.

219
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:29,825
I'm dismissing this case with a warning.

220
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:31,284
Yes, Your Honor.

221
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:32,703
No, no, not you, Mr. Sheeran.

222
00:15:32,786 --> 00:15:35,330
You bring another working man
before this court

223
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,332
with threats instead of evidence,

224
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:38,709
believe me, you'll be sorry.

225
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:41,242
If I owned stock in this company,
I would sell it.

226
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:45,090
/ don't know how he did it,
and I ain't gonna ask.

227
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:48,677
All I know is that Bill Bufalino
got me out of a case

228
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,221
where I should never
have gotten away with it.

229
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:52,615
I should've been down for the count.

230
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,892
People are gonna appreciate
what you did today, Frank.

231
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:58,019
You know, they got families,
they got kids.

232
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:00,397
They need those jobs.

233
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,484
Instead, we went out celebrating...

234
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:04,776
Russell!

235
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,404
And I met what was gonna turn out to be

236
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:08,488
the rest of my life.

237
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,783
You know, I thought that was you
walking in outside.

238
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:12,426
Yeah, yeah, you know, this is our place.

239
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:14,744
Can I introduce you to this new guy Frank?

240
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:16,163
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:18,791
Frank, I want you to meet
my cousin Russell Bufalino.

242
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:20,542
- How are ya?
- Hi, nice to meet you.

243
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,628
You helped me with my truck
a couple of months ago.

244
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,963
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
The timing chain.

245
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:26,756
- Yeah.
- Did you get it fixed?

246
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,520
- I fixed it the next day, yeah.
- Attaboy.

247
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:30,594
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

248
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:32,427
My pleasure. I'm glad you fixed it.

249
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:39,227
You better watch.

250
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:42,061
There's a lot of tough guys around here.
Did he tell ya?

251
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:44,458
You're not afraid of tough guys, are ya?

252
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:45,483
No.

253
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,444
I didn't think so. I'll see you around.

254
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:48,612
- Okay.
- Thanks, Russell.

255
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:50,614
Your cousin saved my ass.

256
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:52,407
I could've lost the whole load.

257
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,035
Yeah, yeah. Well, he knows
everything about trucks, really.

258
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:56,954
Yeah, he worked at Canada Dry
for a long time.

259
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:58,205
- Vito, how are you?
- Pleasure.

260
00:16:58,288 --> 00:16:59,998
I think, Let's take the booth.

261
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:01,708
Come on. You're gonna love this.

262
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,084
Maybe / didn't know

263
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:05,545
who Russell Bufalino was back then,

264
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:08,840
but I'd seen enough pictures and stories
in the newspapers

265
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:10,926
to know he was eatin' with Angelo Bruno.

266
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:15,388
I mean, Bruno, he... he was just made
the new boss of Philadelphia.

267
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:18,267
<i>He took care of everything
from Philadelphia to Atlantic City.</i>

268
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,517
That I knew.

269
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:29,152
And that was all I had to know

270
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:30,737
<i>to know that Russell Bufalino</i>

271
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,615
was no truck mechanic from Canada Dry.

272
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,498
Forty-fifth Infantry.

273
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,959
Minchia.

274
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,336
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Minchia.

275
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:40,140
And don't let anybody
tell you that they weren't afraid.

276
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:42,267
- That's a lot of bullshit. You know?
- Yeah.

277
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,602
Everybody's afraid.
And you pray a lot.

278
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:46,730
I prayed a lot.

279
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:49,357
I prayed that I'd never sin again
as long as I live

280
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,041
if I could just get out of here.

281
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:56,197
But then the fighting starts
and then you forget about everything.

282
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:59,492
You're just trying to survive, stay alive.

283
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:03,538
Once I saw
that I was getting through the war,

284
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:05,582
I looked around me, I said...

285
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,752
I said, "From now on,
whatever happens, happens.”

286
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:13,006
Che successe successe.
Fuck it.

287
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,676
You know, you got orders, you follow them.

288
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,638
They tell you to bring some prisoners
into... into the woods,

289
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:22,807
you know,
and they don't tell you what to do...

290
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,019
But they just say, you know, "Hurry up."

291
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:31,608
It's crazy, but I never understood

292
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:33,985
how they would just keep digging

293
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:35,612
their own graves, you know. I mean...

294
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:36,821
Stop!

295
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:38,448
Raus!!

296
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,080
Well, I mean,
maybe they thought if they did a good job,

297
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:47,665
the guy with the gun

298
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:49,793
would change his mind.

299
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:09,479
<i>Russell,
he... he took a shine to me right away.</i>

300
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:11,981
After a while,

301
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:15,485
he started giving me little things to do.

302
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,571
But then Angelo himself,

303
00:20:18,655 --> 00:20:20,855
he started giving me
little things to do foo.

304
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:27,288
Russ's wife, Carrie, her family

305
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:29,207
goes all the way back, way, way back

306
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,960
to the same town in Sicily
as the Bufalinos.

307
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:34,879
They talked about it all the time.

308
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:38,007
She came from mob royalty,
if you want to call it that.

309
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,220
To them,
it was like they came over on the...

310
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:44,305
the Italian Mayflower.

311
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,169
Why don't you go upstairs, wash up.

312
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:17,630
Give me those clothes.
I'll get rid of them.

313
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,470
Don't forget your shoes, Russell.

314
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:33,980
Hey, Frank,

315
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:36,024
can we stop soon?

316
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:39,569
Yeah, yeah,
well, ask your husband. Russell?

317
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,654
He's out cold.

318
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:53,041
No, no, I got it.

319
00:21:53,124 --> 00:21:54,209
- Sure?
- Yeah.

320
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:01,841
Where are we?

321
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,176
We're close to Lewisburg.

322
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:06,179
Let me know when we get there.
Remind me.

323
00:22:06,262 --> 00:22:08,389
- I got some stops to make.
- Okay.

324
00:22:20,193 --> 00:22:21,893
Russell had a piece of everything.

325
00:22:25,657 --> 00:22:29,410
He had this store in Pittston
called Penn Drape & Curtains.

326
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:31,329
And he ran everything out of there.

327
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:33,957
Who knew what it all was?

328
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,834
I mean, I'm sure the man had partners.

329
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:37,669
They always have partners.

330
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:39,462
Nobody keeps all the money.

331
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:43,508
<i>But everybody listened to Russ.
That I can tell you.</i>

332
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,262
You wanted to bribe a judge,
you asked Russell.

333
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:49,681
You didn't know how much to bribe him,

334
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:51,516
Russell was gonna tell you.

335
00:22:52,141 --> 00:22:54,727
All right, all right.
I'll be right there.

336
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:57,581
Come on. I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.

337
00:22:57,605 --> 00:23:00,191
You want to promote one of your guys,

338
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:02,986
Russ would tell you
you could or you could not.

339
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:04,237
Do me a favor.

340
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,906
Go with Steve down to his place.
Take Vito with you.

341
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,259
And just hang around for a while.

342
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:10,403
These guys keep coming around,
so straighten them out.

343
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:11,828
- I'll take care of it, Russ.
- Okay.

344
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:12,996
- Thank you.
- No problem.

345
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,206
Where's... Here you are.

346
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:15,290
I'm right here.

347
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:17,083
You want to make somebody disappear,

348
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,877
you got to get Russell's permission.

349
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,712
You know, no two ways about It.

350
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:23,631
- No, I wasn't worried.
- I didn't think so.

351
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:26,384
- Tell your father I said "Hi."
- I'll tell him. Thanks.

352
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,147
What are you doing here?
I just told Bruno.

353
00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:29,179
You gotta go with Bruno.

354
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:30,906
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way.
- Yeah. Take care.

355
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,849
And when you did something for Russ,

356
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:34,642
you did it yourself.

357
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:36,519
Like Russ used to say...

358
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:39,105
When I ask somebody
to take care of something for me,

359
00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:41,274
I expect them
to take care of it themselves.

360
00:23:41,357 --> 00:23:43,693
I don't need two roads coming back to me.

361
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:51,010
When Anastasia
got killed in the barbershop,

362
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:54,138
it was Russell they brought in
to calm things down,

363
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:56,933
so that everybody
wasn't just going around killing everybody

364
00:24:57,016 --> 00:24:58,916
and it could all get straightened out.

365
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:01,771
We know what happened.

366
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:03,856
We can't change it. It is what it is.

367
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,818
Please tell my friend I'm happy to help.

368
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:09,487
You'd never know it
by looking at this guy,

369
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,490
but all roads led back to Russ.

370
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:21,499
Where's the money?

371
00:25:21,582 --> 00:25:23,482
- He don't have it.
- He don't have it?

372
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:26,046
He said something, I don't know,
about his mother or...

373
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:27,130
Stop. Don't tell me.

374
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:28,214
Let me guess.

375
00:25:28,715 --> 00:25:31,092
His mother died
and the funeral set him back.

376
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:33,886
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

377
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,346
His fucking mother's...

378
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,930
fucking dying over and over
for the last ten years.

379
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:42,311
- What do I do?
- Don't leave.

380
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:56,075
Here.

381
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,411
Just show it to him. Don't use it.

382
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:17,597
Hey. Look.

383
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,681
Hey, Frank.

384
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,852
Skinny wants to see you.
You get in the car.

385
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:25,685
- I was just gonna go see him.
- Get in the fucking car.

386
00:26:26,272 --> 00:26:27,708
-I was just gonna —
-Get in the fucking car!

387
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:29,710
- I was just gonna go see him!
- Yeah, don't get cute with me.

388
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:31,086
You give me that bullshit
about your mother.

389
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,237
Get in the fucking car!

390
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,630
Frank, I swear to God, I was just gonna...

391
00:26:33,654 --> 00:26:35,239
Get in the fucking car!

392
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:41,370
You want to get cute with me?

393
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:43,134
All that fucking bullshit
about your mother

394
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:44,999
and sick and all that and dying.

395
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:47,311
- I was just gonna go see him.
- You'll see him right now.

396
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:49,062
I swear to God,
I was gonna come see you tomorrow.

397
00:26:49,086 --> 00:26:50,606
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow. I swear to God.

398
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:52,548
Tomorrow. Here.

399
00:26:52,632 --> 00:26:53,692
- What time?
- What time do you want me?

400
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:54,860
One o'clock? I'll be here at 1:00.

401
00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:56,969
One o'clock? What, are you sleeping in?

402
00:26:57,553 --> 00:26:58,679
You tell me.

403
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,598
Ten o'clock. Here.

404
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:01,992
- Ten o'clock. Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

405
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,811
Swear on your mother.
Swear on your mother!

406
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:06,654
- Swear on your mother!
- I swear on my mother!

407
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:09,041
- I swear on my mother!
- What time you gonna be here tomorrow?

408
00:27:09,065 --> 00:27:10,709
- I'll be here at ten o'clock.
- Ten o'clock?

409
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,902
- Tomorrow. Here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

410
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:14,988
I'll bring you the money tomorrow.
The whole thing.

411
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:16,072
Get him out of here.

412
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:18,449
Get out of here.

413
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,136
I swear to God, I'll be here.
How am I supposed to get home?

414
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,210
- Get out of here.
- Take the fucking bus!

415
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:27,208
Let his mother pick him up.

416
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:39,470
What's the matter with her?

417
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:41,331
Nothing.
She knocked something over

418
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:44,100
at the grocery store and made a mess,

419
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:46,186
- and the grocer yelled at her.
- He yelled at her?

420
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,645
Yeah, and he shoved her.

421
00:27:47,728 --> 00:27:48,813
He shoved her?

422
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:50,982
Yeah.

423
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:52,066
Did he shove you?

424
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:54,837
Who was this? The guy at the store?

425
00:27:54,861 --> 00:27:56,737
The grocery store on the corner? Joe?

426
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:01,492
Did he?

427
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:03,661
Honey, did he shove you?

428
00:28:05,621 --> 00:28:07,456
Just answer me. Did he push you?

429
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,940
Did he shove you?
Whatever it is, did he do that?

430
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:11,502
Let's go.

431
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,590
Frank.

432
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:18,176
Frank, he didn't mean it, the man.
It just happened.

433
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:19,319
What do you mean, he didn't mean it?

434
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:20,654
He touched her.
What, are you kidding me?

435
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:22,430
He has no right to push her. Touch her.

436
00:28:22,513 --> 00:28:24,640
Not even put one pinky on her.

437
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,982
That's him, right?

438
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:34,275
Stay here. Stay here.

439
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:40,364
Frank, I'm sorry,
but your kid was out of line.

440
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:42,748
- I only did what...
- You touched my daughter?

441
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,415
God, I'm sorry.

442
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,459
No. Please. No, no, Frank.

443
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:53,502
Frank, please, please, please. No.

444
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:03,054
No, no, Frank! No!

445
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:09,258
- Take that, you motherfucker!
- No! Come on!

446
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:15,816
My fucking hand.
My fucking hand!

447
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:42,510
Dolores.

448
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:51,936
- Amen.
- Amen.

449
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:55,356
Russell and Carrie baptized
our new daughter, Dolores.

450
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:59,276
It was a wonderful occasion,
and we were honored.

451
00:29:59,902 --> 00:30:01,320
Everybody showed up.

452
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:02,405
Amen.

453
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:23,175
- Amen.
- Amen.

454
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,885
<i>(Frank) The only thing is,</i>

455
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:27,722
you got more Kids,
you gotta earn more money.

456
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:32,476
You wanna make a quick ten grand?

457
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,021
Whispers DiTullio.
Not the Whispers

458
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:37,398
they blew up in that car
around the same time.

459
00:30:39,483 --> 00:30:40,693
This was the other Whispers.

460
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:42,776
The good one who knew how to make money.

461
00:30:43,404 --> 00:30:45,197
I got this place I front money to.

462
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:47,283
It's a good business.
Really good business.

463
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:48,409
It's a laundry.

464
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:50,828
What they do is,
they collect the linen, towels,

465
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:54,999
sheets and everything from all the hotels
and restaurants in Atlantic City.

466
00:30:55,082 --> 00:30:56,334
They wash It, they iron it.

467
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:59,920
Normally, it's like a license
to print fucking money.

468
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:01,547
Until recently.

469
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,759
There's this other company
that opened up down in Delaware.

470
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:06,892
They're trying to put us out of business.

471
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:10,556
They're cutting their prices.
They're scaring our drivers.

472
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:13,142
They're trying to take
our customers from us.

473
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:16,687
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little concerned.

474
00:31:16,771 --> 00:31:19,732
Whenever anybody says
they're a little concerned,

475
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:21,108
they're very concerned.

476
00:31:21,192 --> 00:31:23,027
As a matter of fact,

477
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,237
I'm really more than a little concerned.

478
00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:28,783
And when they say
they're more than a little concerned,

479
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:29,992
they're desperate.

480
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:32,036
I want this fucking place bombed,

481
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:34,330
burnt, torched,
whatever the fuck you have to do.

482
00:31:34,413 --> 00:31:36,874
You were in the war. You know what to do.

483
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:39,251
Leave that fucking place
like you left Berlin.

484
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:41,128
Burnt to the fucking ground.

485
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:43,339
I want them out of fucking business.

486
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:44,924
Who... Who are they?

487
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:48,010
It's the Cadillac Linen Service
in Delaware.

488
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:50,471
It's run by a bunch of Jews.

489
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:54,141
Let them collect their insurance,
which I'm sure they have plenty,

490
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:56,393
and leave this fucking other place alone,

491
00:31:56,477 --> 00:31:58,104
the one I'm involved in.

492
00:31:59,605 --> 00:32:01,524
- This ain't ten grand.
- It's two grand.

493
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:03,568
When you put these Jew fucking washerwomen

494
00:32:03,651 --> 00:32:06,403
out of business,
then you get the rest of your money.

495
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:09,407
The reason I'm a little short
on the money right now,

496
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,908
I don't wanna go to Skinny,

497
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:13,578
I don't wanna ask anybody
when they're gonna charge me a vig,

498
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,371
and I'm gonna be paying them forever.

499
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:17,304
I'm getting the money somewhere else.

500
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:19,542
And nobody has to know.

501
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:20,626
Especially not Skinny

502
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:22,809
because I'm not getting
the money from him.

503
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:26,132
And I see you look a little hesitant.

504
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:28,384
Believe me, I know what you can do.

505
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:30,344
If I stiff you on the money,

506
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:32,596
you're gonna do something terrible to me.

507
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,723
I do not want that.

508
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,987
I hit the number.

509
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,572
It's about 1,500.

510
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:51,657
I'll see you in a few hours.

511
00:34:34,468 --> 00:34:35,594
Hey, Frank.

512
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,721
- Hey.
- Hey.

513
00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:39,139
Angelo wants to see you.

514
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:42,393
- Now?
- Yeah, now is good.

515
00:34:43,227 --> 00:34:44,311
What's it about?

516
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:46,855
I don't know. Come on. I'll drive you.

517
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:21,432
Sit down, Frank.

518
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:35,612
What're you doing in Delaware?

519
00:35:42,202 --> 00:35:43,912
Bombing out a laundry place.

520
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:54,465
I was just doing a job
to make some extra money.

521
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:58,344
Putting this place out of action.

522
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,973
Putting this...
Putting this place out of commission.

523
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:05,893
For who?

524
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,614
Now is not the time to not say.

525
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:23,327
Um...

526
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:25,371
Whispers.

527
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:26,663
The other Whispers.

528
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:33,420
You know who owns
the Cadillac Linen Service?

529
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,298
Some Jews in the laundry business.

530
00:36:36,382 --> 00:36:39,301
- That's what they told me.
- They own a part of it.

531
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:41,095
Somebody else got an interest in that.

532
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:42,262
- You know who?
- No.

533
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:43,639
I do.

534
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:46,934
- Who?
- No. I do.

535
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:48,477
I own the other part.

536
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,188
Not I know somebody
who owns the other part.

537
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:58,070
Angelo, I didn't know
you had any part of it.

538
00:36:58,153 --> 00:36:59,822
I would never have done what I did

539
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:01,585
if I knew you were involved.
I didn't know.

540
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:04,034
I would never, never do that against you.

541
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:06,120
Whispers didn't tell you it was Jew mob?

542
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:07,603
No, he said Jew washerwomen.

543
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,334
Jew washerwomen.

544
00:37:13,836 --> 00:37:14,837
What else he say?

545
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:17,923
I bet he said keep it to yourself.

546
00:37:18,006 --> 00:37:20,134
Don't say nothing to nobody Downtown.

547
00:37:23,345 --> 00:37:24,680
He did.

548
00:37:30,102 --> 00:37:31,687
I didn't check.

549
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,480
I'm sorry. I should've checked.

550
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:36,114
- Can I give him his money back?
- He won't need it.

551
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:37,484
You can keep it.

552
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,710
I... I don't want no trouble. I'll just
give it back to him and I'm okay.

553
00:37:42,197 --> 00:37:43,407
He won't need it.

554
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:49,371
Okay. Thanks.

555
00:37:49,455 --> 00:37:50,664
Thank Russell.

556
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,540
I wouldn't have wasted my time.
I'd have let the Jew Mob have you.

557
00:37:57,337 --> 00:37:58,755
You got a good friend here.

558
00:37:59,423 --> 00:38:01,473
You don't know how good a friend you got.

559
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:04,595
- I... I know.
- No, you don't know.

560
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:10,017
Wait by the bar, would you?

561
00:38:26,492 --> 00:38:27,868
/n a case like this,

562
00:38:27,951 --> 00:38:31,246
the best thing to do is
you use something brand new.

563
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,748
Right out of the box.

564
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:34,750
Otherwise, you don't know where it's been.

565
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,543
You don't know who's used it,

566
00:38:36,627 --> 00:38:38,921
what crime it was connected to.

567
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:40,547
That's suicide.

568
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:44,593
<i>So I recommend something new,
straight out of the... the box.</i>

569
00:38:44,676 --> 00:38:46,512
Stone cold. Clean.

570
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:51,225
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

571
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:53,068
I didn't know which way
you were coming from.

572
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:54,561
I didn't know which way...

573
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:03,129
Naturally, the next thing you wanna do

574
00:39:03,153 --> 00:39:05,553
is throw the thing away.
You wanna get rid of it.

575
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:10,516
There's a spot
in the Schuylkill River everybody uses.

576
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:15,946
If they ever send divers down there,
they'd be able to arm a small country.

577
00:39:40,482 --> 00:39:42,609
For me, everything changed after Whispers.

578
00:39:47,823 --> 00:39:49,157
It was like the army.

579
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:52,035
You followed orders.

580
00:39:54,037 --> 00:39:55,289
You did the right thing.

581
00:39:55,998 --> 00:39:57,291
You got rewarded.

582
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:02,129
And when I handled things for Russell,

583
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:03,630
it was never for money,

584
00:40:03,714 --> 00:40:05,549
but as a show of respect.

585
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,302
When you ran a little errand,
you did a little favor,

586
00:40:08,385 --> 00:40:11,138
you got a little favor back
if you ever needed it

587
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:13,140
And you always hurried back.

588
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:15,273
- Hey, Phil, how you doing?
- How are you?

589
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:21,440
Hi. How you doing, Frank?

590
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:33,076
Thank you, Vito.

591
00:40:35,537 --> 00:40:37,456
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

592
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:38,957
What can I get for you?

593
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:41,918
I'm just gonna get the wine now.

594
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,421
Okay.

595
00:40:44,504 --> 00:40:46,548
Just call me if you need anything.

596
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:47,633
I will.

597
00:40:52,638 --> 00:40:54,890
- Help yourself, Frank.
- Thanks.

598
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:57,059
Things change.

599
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:03,857
- She's the new one, right?
- Yeah.

600
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:06,318
A nice kid. Nice kid.

601
00:41:07,694 --> 00:41:08,695
Yeah.

602
00:41:17,245 --> 00:41:20,791
No time Is a good time to leave your wife,

603
00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:23,293
but that's when I left mine.

604
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,096
Hey, Ira, what's going on?

605
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:36,264
- Good. All well?
- Yes.

606
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:40,102
- Any problems?
- No. Everything's good.

607
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:41,853
Thank you.

608
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,930
Right after this Caddy, pull over.

609
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:48,777
There it is. Fair Furriers.

610
00:41:50,904 --> 00:41:52,781
He's expecting you.

611
00:42:18,515 --> 00:42:21,560
- Phil, you got a nice shop here.
- Thanks.

612
00:42:21,643 --> 00:42:23,645
People like to come to this store.

613
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:26,231
But your kid is a real sfigafto.

614
00:42:26,314 --> 00:42:28,264
You understand? He's a pain in the ass.

615
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,111
He's a wild kid.
You gotta learn to control him.

616
00:42:31,194 --> 00:42:34,865
And if you don't,
nobody's gonna want to shop here anymore.

617
00:42:34,948 --> 00:42:37,826
If it's not good for you,
it's not good for me.

618
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,037
You understand what I'm saying.

619
00:42:41,747 --> 00:42:43,599
I want to apologize, Russell,
for the aggravation.

620
00:42:43,623 --> 00:42:46,168
This is from Russell and I.
That's from you and Frank.

621
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:47,878
This one'll be from you and me.

622
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:49,461
Well, what about a baby spoon?

623
00:42:50,255 --> 00:42:51,691
What's she gonna do with a baby spoon?

624
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:53,067
- They're not even married.
- Have a baby.

625
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:54,551
They're not even married yet.

626
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:56,052
I give you my word, Russ.

627
00:42:56,136 --> 00:42:58,555
- All right. Your word's good, Phil.
- Thank you.

628
00:42:58,638 --> 00:43:00,390
Okay, let's go, girls.

629
00:43:00,474 --> 00:43:02,324
- Okay, we're done?
- Yes, we're done.

630
00:43:02,934 --> 00:43:05,270
What are you doing?

631
00:43:05,854 --> 00:43:08,104
- When the hell are you gonna wise up?
- What?

632
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:20,118
Whoa!

633
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,747
There we go. That's my girl.

634
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,499
My God!

635
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,631
Yes!

636
00:43:36,218 --> 00:43:37,511
Hey, Peggy.

637
00:43:38,804 --> 00:43:40,013
Come over here.

638
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,810
I don't know. I don't...

639
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:47,622
I get the feeling she don't like me.

640
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:49,273
- Like she's afraid of me.
- No, no.

641
00:43:49,356 --> 00:43:50,774
That's the way she is.

642
00:43:50,857 --> 00:43:52,359
She's afraid of me at times too.

643
00:43:52,442 --> 00:43:54,402
So, it's just she's a sensitive kid,

644
00:43:54,486 --> 00:43:55,570
but that's all it is.

645
00:43:55,654 --> 00:43:57,254
I can understand her being afraid of me,

646
00:43:57,322 --> 00:43:58,674
but she shouldn't be scared of you, Frank.

647
00:43:58,698 --> 00:43:59,699
No, well...

648
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:02,035
And then she hears about me
in the papers sometimes...

649
00:44:02,118 --> 00:44:03,370
- Really?
- Yeah.

650
00:44:03,453 --> 00:44:06,581
- You gotta be close to your kids, Frank.
- I am. I am.

651
00:44:06,665 --> 00:44:08,208
You're blessed to have them.

652
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,377
I mean, Carrie and I can't have kids.
I told you.

653
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,129
But you're blessed. You're blessed.

654
00:44:13,213 --> 00:44:14,857
Call her. Call her. Tell her to come over.

655
00:44:14,881 --> 00:44:17,092
Hey. Sweetheart. Peggy. Come here.

656
00:44:17,175 --> 00:44:18,176
Come here.

657
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:25,707
- Come here.
- Come over by Uncle Russ.

658
00:44:26,768 --> 00:44:28,603
- How are you?
- Good.

659
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:32,482
Do you know why God made the sky so high?

660
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:35,110
No.

661
00:44:35,193 --> 00:44:38,071
So that the little birdies
don't bunk their head on it

662
00:44:38,154 --> 00:44:39,656
when they're flying around.

663
00:44:40,323 --> 00:44:42,325
Isn't that cute?

664
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:43,952
A little joke.

665
00:44:44,035 --> 00:44:45,412
Isn't that funny?

666
00:44:45,495 --> 00:44:46,789
You want some candy or something?

667
00:44:46,872 --> 00:44:48,206
No.

668
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,417
No, you guys don't want any candy.

669
00:44:52,002 --> 00:44:54,296
There's nothing I could do for you?

670
00:44:54,379 --> 00:44:55,505
No.

671
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:57,591
Well, if there is,
you let Uncle Russell know.

672
00:44:57,674 --> 00:44:58,717
Okay.

673
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,260
Go back. Have some fun.

674
00:45:03,096 --> 00:45:04,222
You see what I mean?

675
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:06,057
You see that feeling I get?

676
00:45:06,141 --> 00:45:08,184
She's just...
She's shy, that's all.

677
00:45:08,268 --> 00:45:09,728
She... She don't mean nothing.

678
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:12,856
Sometimes, when the parents get divorced,

679
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:15,734
the kids get all confused,
and then they get resentful

680
00:45:15,817 --> 00:45:17,611
and they don't know who to take it out on,

681
00:45:17,694 --> 00:45:19,154
or, you know, which side, or...

682
00:45:19,237 --> 00:45:22,324
No, you're right.
I'm lucky in that way because

683
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:25,410
Reenie and Mary,
they get along like gangbusters,

684
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:28,121
so the kids go back and forth
with no problem.

685
00:45:28,204 --> 00:45:30,123
Keep your family close.
Keep an eye on that.

686
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:32,084
Anyway, I'm just telling you, you know.

687
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:34,377
I mean, I'm... I'm just lucky.

688
00:45:35,295 --> 00:45:36,463
Yeah.

689
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:41,134
How's it going with the union?

690
00:45:41,217 --> 00:45:42,719
The union's the best in the world.

691
00:45:42,802 --> 00:45:44,596
- You like it?
- Yeah, well, it's just...

692
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:47,849
I mean, I wish I had something
more steady, but...

693
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:49,100
Yeah, it's...

694
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:51,353
- How about organizing?
- Yeah.

695
00:45:51,436 --> 00:45:53,146
- I would like to do that. But...
- Yeah?

696
00:45:53,229 --> 00:45:54,981
There's a long line.

697
00:45:55,065 --> 00:45:57,165
- A long waiting list, if you will.
- Yeah.

698
00:45:58,276 --> 00:46:01,655
Well, a friend of ours
is having a little trouble.

699
00:46:01,738 --> 00:46:03,990
- Friend at the top.
- Who's that?

700
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,159
The top.

701
00:46:06,242 --> 00:46:08,328
- Hoffa?
- Yeah.

702
00:46:09,204 --> 00:46:10,997
I heard the other day

703
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:13,625
that some guys
tried to pipe him because of

704
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:15,210
- a workman's comp case.
- Yeah.

705
00:46:15,293 --> 00:46:18,046
Yeah, I heard
he beat the shit out of them.

706
00:46:18,129 --> 00:46:19,969
Yeah, but how long
is he gonna keep doing that?

707
00:46:20,006 --> 00:46:21,150
Things are gonna keep happening.

708
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:23,301
He needs somebody he can trust around him.

709
00:46:23,385 --> 00:46:25,428
Somebody to be with him all the time.

710
00:46:25,512 --> 00:46:26,554
Yeah.

711
00:46:30,266 --> 00:46:31,766
Let me put McGee on the phone.

712
00:46:33,812 --> 00:46:34,813
Hello.

713
00:46:35,772 --> 00:46:37,524
Hiya, my friend. How are you?

714
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:41,695
Listen, I got that kid
I was talking to you about here.

715
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:44,864
I'm gonna put him on the phone,
let you talk to him, okay?

716
00:46:44,948 --> 00:46:45,991
All right.

717
00:46:48,076 --> 00:46:49,327
Hello.

718
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:50,870
- Is that Frank?
- Yes.

719
00:46:50,954 --> 00:46:53,081
Hiya, Frank. This is Jimmy Hoffa.

720
00:46:53,164 --> 00:46:54,708
Yeah, yeah. Glad to meet you.

721
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:57,794
Well, glad to meet you, too,
even if it's over the phone.

722
00:46:59,629 --> 00:47:01,506
I heard you paint houses.

723
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:04,634
Yes. Yes, sir, I... I do. I do.

724
00:47:04,718 --> 00:47:05,885
And I...

725
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:07,846
I also do my own carpentry.

726
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:09,764
I'm glad to hear that.

727
00:47:10,515 --> 00:47:12,225
I understand you're a brother of mine.

728
00:47:12,308 --> 00:47:15,478
Yes, sir. Local 107. Since 1947.

729
00:47:15,562 --> 00:47:17,313
Yeah! You know,

730
00:47:17,397 --> 00:47:19,232
our friend speaks very highly of you.

731
00:47:19,315 --> 00:47:21,443
Well, thank you.

732
00:47:21,526 --> 00:47:25,196
- He's not an easy man to please.
- Well, I do my best.

733
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,823
Well, you know, there's a situation...

734
00:47:26,906 --> 00:47:31,119
Nowadays, young people,
they don't know who Jimmy Hoffa was.

735
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:32,954
They don't have a clue.

736
00:47:33,038 --> 00:47:35,749
I mean, maybe they know
that he disappeared or something,

737
00:47:35,832 --> 00:47:37,667
but that's about it

738
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:39,669
But back then, there wasn't nobody

739
00:47:39,753 --> 00:47:43,256
in this country who didn't know
who Jimmy Hoffa was.

740
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:44,549
God bless, Jimmy.

741
00:47:44,632 --> 00:47:46,593
Everything you've done,
you're a real gentleman.

742
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:47,844
God's good.

743
00:47:47,927 --> 00:47:51,056
/n the 50s, he was as big as Elvis.

744
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:53,725
In the '60s, he was like the Beatles.

745
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:55,453
Next to the president, he was like

746
00:47:55,477 --> 00:47:58,229
the most powerful man in the country.
Bar none.

747
00:47:58,313 --> 00:48:00,065
If you got it,

748
00:48:00,148 --> 00:48:02,358
a truck brought it to you.

749
00:48:03,902 --> 00:48:07,030
If you got your food, your clothing,

750
00:48:07,113 --> 00:48:10,283
your medicine,
if you got fuel for your homes,

751
00:48:10,366 --> 00:48:12,202
fuel for your industries,

752
00:48:12,994 --> 00:48:14,954
a truck brought it to them!

753
00:48:17,123 --> 00:48:20,168
The day our trucks stop,

754
00:48:20,251 --> 00:48:21,878
America stops!

755
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:26,091
Well, there's a situation

756
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:29,010
going on now, Frank,
that needs to be attended to.

757
00:48:29,094 --> 00:48:31,494
You know,
they're trying to tear the union apart.

758
00:48:31,888 --> 00:48:35,308
Big business and the government
working together, trying to pull us down.

759
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:37,268
Big business is on the attack!

760
00:48:37,352 --> 00:48:39,604
They're coming! They're coming hard

761
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:40,980
and they're coming fast!

762
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:45,401
Big business and the government
are trying to sow the seeds of dissent

763
00:48:45,485 --> 00:48:47,195
among our ranks,

764
00:48:47,278 --> 00:48:50,698
at a time when we need unity!

765
00:48:50,782 --> 00:48:52,951
We need solidarity!

766
00:48:53,034 --> 00:48:55,411
I want to write it in the sky.

767
00:48:56,162 --> 00:48:57,413
Solidarity!

768
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:00,291
Solidarity!

769
00:49:01,584 --> 00:49:03,086
Solidarity!

770
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:05,255
You wanna be a part of this fight?

771
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:06,631
Yes, I do, sir.

772
00:49:06,714 --> 00:49:09,259
Would you like to be
a part of this history?

773
00:49:09,342 --> 00:49:10,426
Yes, I would.

774
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:13,972
Whatever you need me to do, I'm available.

775
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:15,640
Can you come to Chicago tomorrow?

776
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:16,933
Yes, I can, sir.

777
00:49:17,016 --> 00:49:18,516
All right, then. See you then.

778
00:49:23,148 --> 00:49:25,567
- He likes to talk, don't he?
- Yeah.

779
00:49:30,238 --> 00:49:32,448
Thought I was talking to General Patton.

780
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:40,415
You know, Frank,
the only reason why you're here,

781
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:42,375
the Seafarers Union, they're signing up

782
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:45,170
the same non-union cab drivers

783
00:49:45,253 --> 00:49:46,796
as we want to do.

784
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,048
Nobody knows who you are

785
00:49:49,132 --> 00:49:52,343
and nobody knows
what the fuck you're doing here. Okay?

786
00:49:52,427 --> 00:49:54,137
- Yeah.
- You and I know why you're here.

787
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,973
We gotta be able to sign these drivers up

788
00:49:57,056 --> 00:50:00,185
so Paul Hall doesn't get 'em
for his fucking union.

789
00:50:00,268 --> 00:50:02,604
For some reason, lesbians.

790
00:50:02,687 --> 00:50:04,606
Most of these drivers
are fucking lesbians.

791
00:50:04,689 --> 00:50:06,649
I have no reason why.

792
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:10,445
Paul Hall's running around saying
that he's gonna get a better contract

793
00:50:10,528 --> 00:50:12,322
than our boy fucking Jimmy.

794
00:50:12,405 --> 00:50:14,574
He's a cocksucker. Yeah.

795
00:50:14,657 --> 00:50:18,661
Jimmy has Mayor fucking Daley
in his pocket.

796
00:50:18,745 --> 00:50:21,206
The cops are okay
with whatever the fuck we do.

797
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:23,541
They're not gonna help us
push these cars in,

798
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:26,378
but they certainly are not gonna
let anybody fucking stop us.

799
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:27,462
Okay?

800
00:50:47,982 --> 00:50:49,943
Come on! All of you guys.
Come on!

801
00:50:50,026 --> 00:50:52,676
Let's get this fucking thing in there.
Watch yourself!

802
00:50:54,739 --> 00:50:56,908
This is a lot of work.

803
00:50:56,991 --> 00:50:58,427
Yeah, you ever think of using candy?

804
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:00,161
- What?
- Candy.

805
00:51:00,245 --> 00:51:02,205
What the fuck is candy?

806
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:09,045
Hey, Lou, open the fucking gate.

807
00:51:09,128 --> 00:51:10,797
I got it. I got it.

808
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,924
Here, you take the gas.

809
00:51:29,607 --> 00:51:31,526
Frank, there's one thing about Jimmy.

810
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:33,361
Don't ever make him wait.

811
00:51:33,444 --> 00:51:35,947
If you make a meeting with him,
you get there on time.

812
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,324
Better yet, get there early.

813
00:51:37,407 --> 00:51:38,950
I can't stress this enough.

814
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:42,328
His problem is that time is of essence.

815
00:51:42,412 --> 00:51:44,247
And that's the important thing.

816
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,930
I gotta tell you one more thing.
Jimmy doesn't drink.

817
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,603
Yeah. The head of the largest
trucking union in the world,

818
00:51:49,627 --> 00:51:50,628
he don't drink.

819
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:52,088
The worst part about it is,

820
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:54,371
he doesn't allow anybody
to drink around him.

821
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:00,972
Another thing about him,

822
00:52:01,055 --> 00:52:03,641
Jimmy hates fucking watermelon.

823
00:52:06,644 --> 00:52:08,244
But we're gonna like watermelon.

824
00:52:09,022 --> 00:52:10,940
Jimmy, you shoulda seen it,

825
00:52:11,024 --> 00:52:13,401
sinking in the water.

826
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:15,862
One by one.
I bet you, when they woke up

827
00:52:15,945 --> 00:52:18,489
the next morning,
those fucking cab drivers,

828
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:19,991
they went to look for their cabs,

829
00:52:20,074 --> 00:52:22,024
they didn't know what the fuck hit 'em.

830
00:52:22,702 --> 00:52:24,120
That's a great idea, Joey.

831
00:52:24,203 --> 00:52:25,413
Great idea.

832
00:52:25,496 --> 00:52:27,457
Well, it wasn't my idea.

833
00:52:28,124 --> 00:52:30,585
My man Frank. It was his idea.

834
00:52:30,668 --> 00:52:32,170
Let me tell you something.

835
00:52:32,253 --> 00:52:35,048
Frank hit that pier,
he took over the pier.

836
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:37,217
Whatever he told them to do,
whatever he said,

837
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,468
they did it, you know.

838
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:43,222
I never seen a guy walk
through a crowd like he does.

839
00:52:43,306 --> 00:52:44,616
He doesn't touch a fucking person!

840
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,976
Everybody gets out of the way.

841
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:47,852
I'm not kidding you. I swear.

842
00:52:47,935 --> 00:52:50,272
Guys he never met in his life.
You know, it was like...

843
00:52:50,355 --> 00:52:52,190
like Moses. Remember Moses?

844
00:52:52,273 --> 00:52:54,317
When he walked into the ocean, the sea,

845
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,444
whatever the fuck it was,
and it opened up!

846
00:52:56,527 --> 00:52:59,614
That's him. I'm telling you.
Jimmy, he's got it.

847
00:52:59,697 --> 00:53:00,865
So, what do you think?

848
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:02,742
You need him a couple of days more?

849
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:05,453
Yeah, we gotta clear up
a few dribs and drabs.

850
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:09,791
You guys sure like watermelon.

851
00:53:09,874 --> 00:53:11,376
Want a bite?

852
00:53:11,459 --> 00:53:13,920
Not on your life.

853
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,923
You were there. You saw it firsthand.

854
00:53:17,006 --> 00:53:18,925
Those guys ain't union.

855
00:53:19,008 --> 00:53:23,012
They're like Nazi collaborators,
operating behind the lines.

856
00:53:23,096 --> 00:53:25,723
- You know. You were in the war.
- I sure do.

857
00:53:26,182 --> 00:53:31,145
In a war, you go from point A to point B.

858
00:53:31,896 --> 00:53:33,523
Sometimes,

859
00:53:33,606 --> 00:53:36,484
you spill a little beer along the way.

860
00:53:38,569 --> 00:53:40,238
That philosophy make sense to you?

861
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:41,364
Sure does.

862
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:43,533
Good.

863
00:54:00,425 --> 00:54:02,510
Jimmy, he didn't make me stay in his suite

864
00:54:02,593 --> 00:54:04,011
because he liked me.

865
00:54:04,595 --> 00:54:06,681
He made me stay with him
because he didn't want me

866
00:54:06,764 --> 00:54:08,975
registering in my name at the hotel,

867
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:13,146
This way, there was no proof
I was even in Chicago.

868
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,324
Come on, Jimmy, you're way behind.

869
00:54:25,408 --> 00:54:26,951
Nothing stops her.

870
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:29,537
After Chicago, Jimmy and / got close.

871
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,788
The wives hit it off

872
00:54:31,414 --> 00:54:33,166
And with Jimmy and Josephine's kids

873
00:54:33,249 --> 00:54:35,043
mostly grown up and out of the house,

874
00:54:35,126 --> 00:54:36,961
they got a kick out of our kids foo.

875
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:38,754
Jimmy, Peggy, let's get a picture.

876
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:40,089
Yes. Come on.

877
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:41,549
Especially Peggy.

878
00:54:41,632 --> 00:54:44,510
She and Jimmy,
they fell for each other right away.

879
00:54:45,678 --> 00:54:48,890
You know what I like even better
than getting my picture took?

880
00:54:48,973 --> 00:54:49,974
What?

881
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:53,561
Surprise!

882
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:55,062
Peggy!

883
00:54:55,146 --> 00:54:57,231
70 Peggy, Jimmy wasn't like Russ,

884
00:54:57,315 --> 00:54:59,108
or Skinny or even me.

885
00:54:59,192 --> 00:55:02,403
Sorry, everybody.
This is just for Peggy and I.

886
00:55:02,487 --> 00:55:04,531
For one thing,
Jimmy didn't have a nickname

887
00:55:04,614 --> 00:55:06,949
like "The Razor," or "The Hunchback,”

888
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:09,160
or "The Weasel,” or "Whispers."

889
00:55:09,243 --> 00:55:11,162
So what happened to "Thank you"?

890
00:55:11,245 --> 00:55:12,747
Thank you!

891
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,500
And also, to her, he was helping people.

892
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:18,377
He was helping them
make more money, live better lives.

893
00:55:18,461 --> 00:55:21,214
He wasn't stomping on somebody's hand.

894
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:25,301
"If you have it,
a truck brought it to you."

895
00:55:25,384 --> 00:55:26,928
This is what Mr. Hoffa says.

896
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:29,472
He's the president of the Teamsters Union

897
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:31,599
with over a million members.

898
00:55:31,682 --> 00:55:34,560
They all support him
because they have steady jobs,

899
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:37,313
great pay and a pension
for when they retire.

900
00:55:38,689 --> 00:55:40,316
The Teamster Pension Fund

901
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:42,360
had eight billion dollars in it.

902
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:46,113
And Jimmy had complete control
over every bit of It.

903
00:55:46,197 --> 00:55:48,783
Isn't this a beautiful presentation?

904
00:55:48,866 --> 00:55:51,516
I mean, a bridge loan is really
all I'm asking, Jimmy.

905
00:55:51,953 --> 00:55:54,622
I'm not gonna piss away
my members' pension dough

906
00:55:54,705 --> 00:55:55,957
on something too risky.

907
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,875
This is not a risk, Jimmy.

908
00:55:57,959 --> 00:56:00,211
I got Minsky's Follies.

909
00:56:00,294 --> 00:56:02,672
I got the first topless act on the Strip.

910
00:56:02,755 --> 00:56:04,233
I'm telling you, we're booming in there.

911
00:56:04,257 --> 00:56:05,400
I can't get the drinks out...

912
00:56:05,424 --> 00:56:07,051
Just asking for a golf course.

913
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:08,529
You know you never lost a dime with me.

914
00:56:08,553 --> 00:56:10,513
Jimmy, we'd really just appreciate

915
00:56:10,596 --> 00:56:12,282
whatever you could do
to help Jake along here.

916
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:14,809
One-five is all I need
for a completion bond.

917
00:56:17,353 --> 00:56:20,022
Okay. Okay. Go to the bank.

918
00:56:20,106 --> 00:56:21,232
Thank you.

919
00:56:21,315 --> 00:56:22,417
It's gonna be a big success.

920
00:56:22,441 --> 00:56:24,402
Thank you, Jimmy. You're a prince.

921
00:56:24,485 --> 00:56:26,487
- You're a mensch.
- Yeah, I'm a mensch.

922
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:37,081
Ana, because of Mr. Hoffa,

923
00:56:37,164 --> 00:56:40,167
workers have medical insurance
for when they get sick,

924
00:56:40,251 --> 00:56:44,171
and know when they retire,
they're not going to go hungry.

925
00:56:45,631 --> 00:56:47,425
There was so much paperwork back then

926
00:56:47,508 --> 00:56:49,344
<i>that Jimmy had to use an insurance company</i>

927
00:56:49,427 --> 00:56:53,097
<i>that was run by this kid, Allen Dorfman,
to work out the loans.</i>

928
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,599
No, no, nothing for nothing.

929
00:56:54,682 --> 00:56:57,082
Next time,
try asking a little bit fucking nicer.

930
00:57:01,897 --> 00:57:04,191
And? And? How'd it go?

931
00:57:04,275 --> 00:57:06,861
It was a little touch and go
for a little bit.

932
00:57:06,944 --> 00:57:08,487
- But at the end, fine.
- Good.

933
00:57:08,571 --> 00:57:09,822
/t was Russ who got Jimmy

934
00:57:09,905 --> 00:57:11,658
to give guys like Gottlieb the loans,

935
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:14,410
and, you know,
he would get like 70% of that.

936
00:57:14,493 --> 00:57:16,954
Or whatever, you know. Maybe more.

937
00:57:17,038 --> 00:57:20,374
Listen, you tell Marteduzzo
from me that I appreciate it.

938
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:21,960
And everybody's gonna appreciate it.

939
00:57:22,043 --> 00:57:24,003
- It's a good thing.
- Okay. I'll do that.

940
00:57:24,086 --> 00:57:26,005
Back then,
you couldn't go to regular banks

941
00:57:26,088 --> 00:57:27,757
because the money was for gambling.

942
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,426
God's truth, that's what it was.
I'm serious. You couldn't

943
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:32,303
So the Mob, what did they do?

944
00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:34,180
They went to the Teamsters for the money.

945
00:57:34,263 --> 00:57:36,057
It was the Teamsters that stepped in

946
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,017
and lent the money that built Las Vegas.

947
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,852
- This is the mahogany...
- Don't, Billy.

948
00:57:39,935 --> 00:57:41,215
- Don't touch the stuff.
- I won't.

949
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:42,730
- Just go where you gotta go.
- Okay.

950
00:57:42,813 --> 00:57:45,399
There was more business
than anybody could handle.

951
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:49,403
So Jimmy had to shove some
of the deals off onto his wife Jo,

952
00:57:49,487 --> 00:57:51,656
who had no idea she had 22%

953
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:54,408
of a Florida land deal
called "Sun Valley,"

954
00:57:54,492 --> 00:57:56,118
some charter fishing boats,

955
00:57:56,202 --> 00:57:58,412
and a ski lodge with its own mountain.

956
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:07,088
One of Jimmy's clients
was Sam "Momo" Giancana,

957
00:58:07,171 --> 00:58:09,716
who was friends with the Kennedys
from back when Jack's father

958
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:11,676
made his fortune with the Italians

959
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:13,844
as a bootlegger during Prohibition.

960
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:17,598
Momo, Sinatra hung out together
with the Kennedys.

961
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,726
Momo and Kennedy,

962
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,146
believe it or not,
even had the same girlfriend.

963
00:58:23,229 --> 00:58:25,272
Together. At the same time.

964
00:58:25,815 --> 00:58:26,941
Talk about crazy.

965
00:58:27,817 --> 00:58:29,986
So it was easy for the Mob
to help Joe Kennedy

966
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:32,571
get his son elected president.
That was easy.

967
00:58:33,197 --> 00:58:35,033
They just punched up the vote a little

968
00:58:35,116 --> 00:58:37,576
<i>to make sure that he won in Illinois.</i>

969
00:58:41,163 --> 00:58:42,832
In exchange for that,

970
00:58:42,915 --> 00:58:46,210
the new president was supposedly
gonna get Castro out of Cuba

971
00:58:46,293 --> 00:58:48,879
SO our guys could get their casinos back,

972
00:58:48,963 --> 00:58:50,965
and race tracks, and shrimp boats,

973
00:58:51,048 --> 00:58:52,408
and everything else that they had,

974
00:58:52,466 --> 00:58:54,844
and owned down there from Havana back.

975
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:56,846
But that... that didn't happen.

976
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:07,898
The Italians wanted Kennedy
the Irishman for president,

977
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:09,942
and that's what they got.

978
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:14,822
Get used to it,
because we're gonna be seeing it 24/7.

979
00:59:14,905 --> 00:59:16,449
Son of a bitch!

980
00:59:16,532 --> 00:59:17,575
Goddamn Kennedys.

981
00:59:17,658 --> 00:59:19,094
I'm looking at the goddamn Kennedys.

982
00:59:19,118 --> 00:59:21,078
Jimmy, the kids. Language.

983
00:59:21,162 --> 00:59:23,038
What difference does it make?

984
00:59:23,122 --> 00:59:24,762
I mean, they gotta learn sooner or later.

985
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:26,542
We're going to war with these people.

986
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:27,752
War!

987
00:59:28,669 --> 00:59:30,546
If I said it once,
I said it a thousand times,

988
00:59:30,629 --> 00:59:32,381
I don't care they're Irish.

989
00:59:33,048 --> 00:59:34,592
I don't care they're Catholic.

990
00:59:34,675 --> 00:59:38,053
If there's one person
you can't trust in this life,

991
00:59:38,137 --> 00:59:39,638
it's millionaires' kids.

992
00:59:39,722 --> 00:59:41,515
You're right, Jimmy.

993
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,226
Especially that little son of a bitch.

994
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,897
Are you saying you don't remember

995
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,149
doing any favors for Johnny Dio,

996
00:59:50,232 --> 00:59:52,182
or you don't remember the conversation?

997
00:59:53,277 --> 00:59:56,489
I'm saying,
to the best of my recollection,

998
00:59:57,072 --> 00:59:59,492
I must recall on my memory,

999
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:01,452
I cannot remember.

1000
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:06,582
Then where did this $20,000 come from?

1001
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:09,627
Individuals.

1002
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:12,463
Which individuals, Mr. Hoffa?

1003
01:00:14,924 --> 01:00:19,804
Offhand, that particular amount of money
I borrowed,

1004
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:22,431
I don't know at this particular moment.

1005
01:00:23,307 --> 01:00:28,145
But the record of my loans,
which I requested, I have,

1006
01:00:28,229 --> 01:00:30,523
and out of all the moneys I loaned

1007
01:00:30,606 --> 01:00:34,485
during this period of time
I went into these ventures.

1008
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:42,034
Those goddamn Kennedys,

1009
01:00:42,117 --> 01:00:43,536
they get what they want!

1010
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:44,662
Jimmy. Jimmy, the kids.

1011
01:00:44,745 --> 01:00:46,497
Him and all the bullshit problems

1012
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,374
- he put me through already.
- Jimmy.

1013
01:00:48,457 --> 01:00:50,585
I gotta go.
You don't expect me to look at this.

1014
01:00:50,668 --> 01:00:52,044
No, I don't.

1015
01:00:52,837 --> 01:00:54,463
- Whoa!
- For guys like Russ,

1016
01:00:54,547 --> 01:00:55,965
it couldn't have been better.

1017
01:00:56,048 --> 01:00:57,132
I mean, Russ,

1018
01:00:57,216 --> 01:01:00,636
yeah, he did his part
for getting Kennedy elected,

1019
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:01,720
that's for sure.

1020
01:01:01,804 --> 01:01:03,198
What are you doing?
I told you to put it...

1021
01:01:03,222 --> 01:01:05,700
I told you to put them on every pole.
You're still walking around.

1022
01:01:05,724 --> 01:01:06,934
So what's the first thing

1023
01:01:07,017 --> 01:01:09,937
that Jack Kennedy does
to thank Chicago for all their help?

1024
01:01:10,855 --> 01:01:13,190
He puts his shit-ass brother in there,

1025
01:01:13,274 --> 01:01:14,525
that little prep school punk,

1026
01:01:14,608 --> 01:01:17,027
and he winds up making him
attorney general.

1027
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:21,782
And what's the first thing Bobby does?

1028
01:01:21,866 --> 01:01:23,742
He goes after not just Jimmy,

1029
01:01:23,826 --> 01:01:26,412
which in a way you could understand.

1030
01:01:26,495 --> 01:01:28,331
I mean, Jimmy hated the Kennedys so much

1031
01:01:28,414 --> 01:01:31,166
he gave Nixon a half a million dollars
in Teamster cash.

1032
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,961
But Bobby also goes after Giancana,

1033
01:01:34,044 --> 01:01:37,339
Marcello, Trafficante,
and all the other guys

1034
01:01:37,423 --> 01:01:40,384
who put his brother in the White House
in the first place.

1035
01:01:42,595 --> 01:01:43,846
What's that about?

1036
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:45,014
Frank.

1037
01:01:45,097 --> 01:01:46,765
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

1038
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:47,999
Am I missing something?

1039
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:50,019
Thank you, Carrie.

1040
01:01:54,106 --> 01:01:56,108
- That's gorgeous.
- Beautiful.

1041
01:01:57,109 --> 01:01:59,695
Wear it in the best of health.
We love you.

1042
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:02,823
Okay, now this one is for Peggy

1043
01:02:02,907 --> 01:02:05,659
from Uncle Russell.
Merry Christmas, my love.

1044
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:08,203
Look at those.

1045
01:02:10,122 --> 01:02:11,790
So nice!

1046
01:02:11,874 --> 01:02:13,584
I heard you like to skate.

1047
01:02:15,169 --> 01:02:16,420
What do you say?

1048
01:02:18,297 --> 01:02:19,298
Thank you.

1049
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:21,843
Now me and Uncle Russell
could take you ice skating.

1050
01:02:21,926 --> 01:02:25,763
I think Santa Claus left you
a little something extra in there too.

1051
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,561
What do you say to Uncle Russell?

1052
01:02:34,229 --> 01:02:35,856
What do you say?

1053
01:02:38,192 --> 01:02:39,652
Frank, it's all right.

1054
01:02:40,277 --> 01:02:42,821
She said thank you once.
That's enough.

1055
01:02:45,908 --> 01:02:48,744
With Bobby as attorney general,
I mean, they were all over us.

1056
01:02:48,827 --> 01:02:50,913
I mean, we couldn't talk on the phone

1057
01:02:50,996 --> 01:02:52,873
because we knew it was being bugged.

1058
01:02:52,957 --> 01:02:54,768
You couldn't do nothing.
You couldn't go nowhere.

1059
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:56,043
You couldn't do anything.

1060
01:02:56,126 --> 01:02:58,420
It was a bad, bad, bad situation.

1061
01:02:58,504 --> 01:03:00,589
And then Jimmy... Forget it.

1062
01:03:00,673 --> 01:03:03,217
Bobby, now as attorney general,
he has the power

1063
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,386
to send anybody to all,
and no question about it.

1064
01:03:05,469 --> 01:03:07,930
And Jimmy was at the top
of Bobby's hit list.

1065
01:03:08,013 --> 01:03:10,683
He even set up
a special "Get Hoffa Squad,”

1066
01:03:10,766 --> 01:03:12,560
where he had his own guys from the FBI,

1067
01:03:12,643 --> 01:03:14,436
the IRS working round the clock.

1068
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,439
Their only job
was to put Jimmy Hoffa in jail.

1069
01:03:17,523 --> 01:03:19,173
<i>I'm serious. That's all they did.</i>

1070
01:03:21,819 --> 01:03:25,864
I am sitting in a room
full of fuckin' idiots.

1071
01:03:27,491 --> 01:03:29,952
You dumb motherfuckers!

1072
01:03:30,035 --> 01:03:31,662
You know what you did?

1073
01:03:31,745 --> 01:03:34,164
You take Johnny O'Rourke's kid

1074
01:03:34,873 --> 01:03:36,417
and you put him on

1075
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,711
as general organizer,

1076
01:03:39,503 --> 01:03:42,214
pay him 36 fucking grand,

1077
01:03:42,297 --> 01:03:44,299
at the same time...

1078
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:49,346
you let him sell insurance
to his fucking father's...

1079
01:03:58,105 --> 01:04:00,232
to his fucking father's...

1080
01:04:01,025 --> 01:04:04,778
to his fucking father's locals!

1081
01:04:04,862 --> 01:04:05,863
Damn it!

1082
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:09,241
How do you do that?

1083
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:12,703
How stupid can you be?

1084
01:04:15,372 --> 01:04:17,875
That fucking cocksucker Kennedy

1085
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:21,420
has got his nose up my ass
everywhere I go!

1086
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,381
You don't know that they're hounding me?

1087
01:04:23,464 --> 01:04:24,882
They're looking at everything I do.

1088
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:27,342
And you let this happen in public!

1089
01:04:28,385 --> 01:04:29,720
You're giving it to him!

1090
01:04:29,803 --> 01:04:31,805
I'm going to jail. You understand?

1091
01:04:32,723 --> 01:04:34,850
I'm going to prison because of you,

1092
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:37,186
you dumb motherfuckers.

1093
01:04:37,269 --> 01:04:39,647
This is what you wanted.
You wanted to put me in jail.

1094
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:41,607
Tell me now so I can kill you right here.

1095
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:43,067
Right here!

1096
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:50,425
- Where're you going?
- What do you mean, where am I going?

1097
01:04:50,449 --> 01:04:52,009
I fucking quit, that's where I'm going.

1098
01:04:52,034 --> 01:04:53,119
What are you quitting for?

1099
01:04:53,202 --> 01:04:55,287
You gonna call me a motherfucker?

1100
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:57,348
You can talk to them like that,
you can't talk to me like that.

1101
01:04:57,372 --> 01:04:59,500
Frank. No! That didn't apply to you.
What are you...

1102
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:00,584
-Didn't apply? Not

1103
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:02,187
Then you gotta let me know
it didn't apply to me.

1104
01:05:02,211 --> 01:05:04,964
- I'm standing right there.
- I didn't even see you standing there!

1105
01:05:05,047 --> 01:05:06,549
I was standing right there, Jimmy.

1106
01:05:06,632 --> 01:05:07,800
What are you talking about?

1107
01:05:07,883 --> 01:05:10,233
But it didn't apply to you!
What else can I say?

1108
01:05:12,054 --> 01:05:14,348
You got a problem, you pull me aside.

1109
01:05:14,431 --> 01:05:16,701
You don't insult me
and then you say it didn't apply to me.

1110
01:05:16,725 --> 01:05:18,953
How am I gonna put you aside?
I didn't even see you there.

1111
01:05:18,977 --> 01:05:21,897
Come on, Frank,
you know me better than that.

1112
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:23,816
You just know me better than that.

1113
01:05:23,899 --> 01:05:25,109
Please.

1114
01:05:25,192 --> 01:05:27,319
Come on. It's gonna be all right.

1115
01:05:27,402 --> 01:05:29,279
It's gonna be all right. Come on.

1116
01:05:29,363 --> 01:05:31,382
Come on, why would I ever
say anything like that to you?

1117
01:05:31,406 --> 01:05:32,634
You gotta control these people.

1118
01:05:32,658 --> 01:05:34,302
I'm controlling everything.
Don't worry about it.

1119
01:05:34,326 --> 01:05:36,912
But certainly, certainly, I... you know.

1120
01:05:37,788 --> 01:05:39,873
Come on. Okay, guys, get out of here now.

1121
01:05:40,499 --> 01:05:43,586
([Frank stammers) / mean, / don't know how
Jimmy is running the fucking union.

1122
01:05:43,669 --> 01:05:46,171
Between Bobby and the FBI
up his ass all the time,

1123
01:05:46,255 --> 01:05:47,840
he's going fucking crazy.

1124
01:05:48,632 --> 01:05:51,260
Tell Jimmy I'm sorry for his troubles.

1125
01:05:51,343 --> 01:05:53,763
The old-timers know the Old Man.
They'll talk to him.

1126
01:05:53,846 --> 01:05:55,931
At some point,
they'll straighten it out for him.

1127
01:05:56,014 --> 01:05:57,308
Yeah, but he can't understand,

1128
01:05:57,391 --> 01:05:59,672
and I gotta be honest with you,
I don't understand either,

1129
01:05:59,726 --> 01:06:01,830
how youse could help get
those two fucking Kennedy pricks

1130
01:06:01,854 --> 01:06:03,022
elected in the first place.

1131
01:06:03,105 --> 01:06:04,945
It don't make no sense to him,
that's for sure.

1132
01:06:04,982 --> 01:06:07,109
He doesn't have to understand everything.

1133
01:06:07,192 --> 01:06:09,445
You know what I'm talking about.
Sometimes it's better.

1134
01:06:09,528 --> 01:06:10,779
Well...

1135
01:06:10,863 --> 01:06:13,115
When I see him like that,
I don't, you know,

1136
01:06:13,198 --> 01:06:14,742
I... I'm tryin' to... I feel bad.

1137
01:06:14,825 --> 01:06:16,952
I wanna help him in some way.

1138
01:06:17,035 --> 01:06:19,079
Listen, he's too emotional.

1139
01:06:19,163 --> 01:06:21,248
Like some guy who's always
rushing, rushing

1140
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:24,209
all over the place
and they miss the big picture.

1141
01:06:24,293 --> 01:06:26,253
Like Cuba.

1142
01:06:28,088 --> 01:06:31,049
Getting us back into casinos.

1143
01:06:31,133 --> 01:06:33,510
Getting us back into Havana.

1144
01:06:33,594 --> 01:06:36,597
Like getting rid
of that fucking Castro prick.

1145
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:42,561
The old-timers spoke to the Old Man.

1146
01:06:42,644 --> 01:06:45,981
The Old Man talked to his son Jack,
and he told him,

1147
01:06:46,064 --> 01:06:48,650
"Don't forget who the fuck he owes."

1148
01:06:50,611 --> 01:06:53,280
He knows who the fuck he owes.

1149
01:06:54,698 --> 01:06:56,658
So I want you

1150
01:06:56,742 --> 01:07:00,245
to go down to a place
called Milestone Hauling.

1151
01:07:01,705 --> 01:07:03,916
There's a guy named Phil.

1152
01:07:03,999 --> 01:07:05,500
He's gonna give you a rig.

1153
01:07:13,008 --> 01:07:15,636
<i>You drive the rig down to Baltimore</i>

1154
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:17,429
lo a concrete plant.

1155
01:07:17,512 --> 01:07:18,847
It's on Eastern Avenue.

1156
01:07:18,931 --> 01:07:21,516
It's the only one on the street.
You cant miss it

1157
01:07:25,938 --> 01:07:27,522
A guy's gonna meet you there.

1158
01:07:27,606 --> 01:07:29,816
A fairy named Ferrie.

1159
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:33,237
Just pull it forward and then back it in.

1160
01:07:44,581 --> 01:07:45,707
Let's go, let's go.

1161
01:07:54,716 --> 01:07:56,510
You'll pick up some things.

1162
01:07:57,219 --> 01:08:00,013
He'll give you some paperwork
in case you get stopped.

1163
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:12,526
You drive the truck down to Florida.

1164
01:08:13,568 --> 01:08:15,612
A dog track outside Jacksonville.

1165
01:08:17,739 --> 01:08:18,740
You leave it there.

1166
01:08:19,825 --> 01:08:23,912
A guy with big ears named Hunt
will meet you there.

1167
01:08:25,122 --> 01:08:28,375
He's gonna give you a car
to drive back to Philly.

1168
01:08:41,888 --> 01:08:43,432
What are you looking at?

1169
01:08:43,515 --> 01:08:44,975
You looking at my ears?

1170
01:08:46,685 --> 01:08:47,686
Sorry?

1171
01:08:47,769 --> 01:08:49,187
My ears.

1172
01:08:49,271 --> 01:08:51,321
- Are you looking at my ears?
- Your ears?

1173
01:08:52,316 --> 01:08:53,608
No.

1174
01:08:54,568 --> 01:08:57,237
I had an operation,
so there's no need for anyone

1175
01:08:57,321 --> 01:08:58,780
looking at my ears anymore.

1176
01:08:58,864 --> 01:09:01,074
Yeah, well, I ain't looking at your ears.

1177
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:02,159
Right.

1178
01:09:04,578 --> 01:09:06,371
Get out of here. Go on.

1179
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:29,478
Unfolded in the Bay of Pigs.

1180
01:09:29,561 --> 01:09:31,146
Nothing went as planned.

1181
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:32,564
Paratroopers were unable

1182
01:09:32,647 --> 01:09:34,817
to blow up roadways
leading to the beach area.

1183
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,069
Castro raced toward the scene.

1184
01:09:37,152 --> 01:09:39,464
The underground might have blown up
the roads but it knew nothing.

1185
01:09:39,488 --> 01:09:42,282
Soon, Castro had artillery
firing on the beachhead.

1186
01:09:42,366 --> 01:09:44,034
His planes destroyed invading ships

1187
01:09:44,117 --> 01:09:46,453
carrying a brigade of men
and vital ammunition.

1188
01:09:46,536 --> 01:09:48,288
The beachhead could not be enlarged

1189
01:09:48,372 --> 01:09:50,833
and paratroopers were soon
trying to fight their way back

1190
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:54,044
to the small section of the shore
where the invaders were pinned down.

1191
01:09:54,127 --> 01:09:57,047
1,500 men had been dumped
on a shore without air cover

1192
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,840
or protective fire from ships.

1193
01:09:58,924 --> 01:10:01,427
Castro had to wait
only until they ran out of ammunition

1194
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:02,969
before mopping them up.

1195
01:10:03,053 --> 01:10:06,556
Later, Castro was to strut around
the invasion area with newsmen,

1196
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,726
and expound on the errors
that had been made.

1197
01:10:08,809 --> 01:10:10,394
He had ample material.

1198
01:10:10,477 --> 01:10:13,271
The United States, already humiliated,

1199
01:10:13,355 --> 01:10:16,066
stood condemned
by most of the countries of the world.

1200
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:20,070
Shit! Just as I predicted.
They fuck up Cuba...

1201
01:10:21,154 --> 01:10:23,323
Boobie starts coming after me
and the union.

1202
01:10:24,116 --> 01:10:26,159
He's looking for some cheap publicity.

1203
01:10:26,243 --> 01:10:28,120
That's all it is.
That's what he's doing.

1204
01:10:28,203 --> 01:10:29,680
Okay.
Well, it's all gonna blow over, Jimmy.

1205
01:10:29,704 --> 01:10:32,207
No, it's not gonna blow over.
How's it gonna blow over?

1206
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,126
They're never gonna forget

1207
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:37,504
- that I gave money to Nixon!
- Calm down. Jimmy, please.

1208
01:10:37,587 --> 01:10:38,672
We're gonna handle this.

1209
01:10:38,755 --> 01:10:41,675
Couple of the old-timers,
they're gonna get to Old Man Kennedy now.

1210
01:10:41,758 --> 01:10:43,444
Okay? They're gonna get to him.
He's a little sick, but...

1211
01:10:43,468 --> 01:10:44,636
- Sick?
- Yeah. But...

1212
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,472
He had a fucking stroke.
That's not sick.

1213
01:10:47,556 --> 01:10:49,933
That's you're...
you're close to the grave, is what.

1214
01:10:50,016 --> 01:10:51,977
He's turning into a fucking eggplant.

1215
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,271
Okay. Well, you can't blame
anybody for that. That's...

1216
01:10:54,354 --> 01:10:55,665
I'm not looking to blame anybody.

1217
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:58,025
But if there's any blame going around,
it's the Kennedys.

1218
01:10:58,108 --> 01:11:00,110
His kids killed him. Let me tell you that.

1219
01:11:00,193 --> 01:11:02,737
He's not dead, but he's going.
He's going.

1220
01:11:02,821 --> 01:11:05,782
They killed him.
They'd give anybody a heart attack.

1221
01:11:40,609 --> 01:11:41,735
Where are you going?

1222
01:11:42,736 --> 01:11:43,737
I'm going to work.

1223
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:46,281
Go back to sleep.

1224
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:38,416
All I can say Is that, we will not stop.

1225
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,877
Because we've been
doing that for 50 years!

1226
01:12:42,379 --> 01:12:43,922
What good does it do?

1227
01:12:44,005 --> 01:12:47,259
Let the lawyers...
Let the lawyers drive a truck.

1228
01:12:47,342 --> 01:12:50,220
They need their pencils
and papers and their ink pads.

1229
01:12:52,055 --> 01:12:54,391
That's... That's a whole other story.

1230
01:12:54,474 --> 01:12:56,309
But we're gonna get through this.

1231
01:12:56,393 --> 01:12:59,312
We're gonna get through
this legal bullshit

1232
01:12:59,396 --> 01:13:01,773
and garbage they're throwing at us.

1233
01:13:01,856 --> 01:13:04,234
We're gonna get through it because

1234
01:13:04,317 --> 01:13:07,028
"Boobie" Kennedy wants something,
that doesn't mean

1235
01:13:07,112 --> 01:13:08,905
the rich boy is gonna get it.

1236
01:13:08,989 --> 01:13:11,157
You understand what I'm saying?

1237
01:13:11,241 --> 01:13:13,691
I don't care what he wants.
He's not gonna get it!

1238
01:13:15,954 --> 01:13:19,040
He's not gonna get it because

1239
01:13:19,124 --> 01:13:22,711
we are the biggest and best,

1240
01:13:22,794 --> 01:13:25,547
and most honest union

1241
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,382
in this country!

1242
01:13:27,465 --> 01:13:28,508
Yeah, that's right.

1243
01:13:28,592 --> 01:13:29,926
I waited for that!

1244
01:13:35,015 --> 01:13:38,393
And you know the operative word
I'm talking about here.

1245
01:13:38,476 --> 01:13:40,562
- Solidarity.
- Yeah!

1246
01:13:40,645 --> 01:13:42,564
And it works. It works for all of us.

1247
01:13:42,647 --> 01:13:47,068
And it works for our friend here,
Frank Fitzsimmons!

1248
01:13:47,152 --> 01:13:49,195
Frank Fitzsimmons here,

1249
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:52,490
my executive vice president.

1250
01:13:52,574 --> 01:13:55,827
If there's anyone that can do
this job, it's this man here.

1251
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:58,538
And with him at my back,

1252
01:13:58,622 --> 01:14:00,624
where are we gonna go but up!

1253
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:03,835
Is that right, Fitz?

1254
01:14:03,918 --> 01:14:05,754
All the way, Jimmy!

1255
01:14:05,837 --> 01:14:08,590
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1256
01:14:08,673 --> 01:14:10,925
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1257
01:14:11,009 --> 01:14:13,553
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1258
01:14:13,637 --> 01:14:16,056
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1259
01:14:16,139 --> 01:14:18,433
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1260
01:14:18,516 --> 01:14:20,268
Hoffa! Hoffa! Hoffa!

1261
01:14:20,352 --> 01:14:22,479
A union man!

1262
01:14:24,648 --> 01:14:26,524
You know, I felt they liked Fitz.

1263
01:14:26,608 --> 01:14:27,859
No two ways about it.

1264
01:14:27,942 --> 01:14:30,236
Yeah, you gave Fitz some buildup.

1265
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,820
I mean, I hope he deserves it.

1266
01:14:33,657 --> 01:14:35,450
Why? What's wrong with Fitz?

1267
01:14:37,077 --> 01:14:39,121
I don't know.
I don't want to knock the guy,

1268
01:14:39,204 --> 01:14:40,289
but I... I don't know.

1269
01:14:40,372 --> 01:14:42,541
Well, you're not knocking him.
Just tell me...

1270
01:14:42,624 --> 01:14:44,292
Tell me what you feel.

1271
01:14:45,001 --> 01:14:46,878
I mean, he's a loyal guy, I'm sure.

1272
01:14:47,545 --> 01:14:49,172
He's a nice guy,

1273
01:14:49,255 --> 01:14:51,508
but he ain't that sharp.
He ain't that smart.

1274
01:14:51,591 --> 01:14:52,718
And he's also like a...

1275
01:14:52,801 --> 01:14:54,720
He plays a lot of fucking golf, you know.

1276
01:14:54,803 --> 01:14:55,929
He plays golf?

1277
01:14:56,721 --> 01:14:58,807
So what?
That's what you want from a number two.

1278
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:00,892
You don't want somebody too smart.

1279
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:04,104
You want a nice guy.
People like him, you know.

1280
01:15:04,187 --> 01:15:06,064
Not dumb, but somebody,

1281
01:15:06,147 --> 01:15:07,583
you know you can have walking behind you

1282
01:15:07,607 --> 01:15:09,609
without getting knifed.

1283
01:15:09,693 --> 01:15:12,320
- Well, I hope you're right.
- I'm always right.

1284
01:15:12,404 --> 01:15:15,365
I can sleep like a babe with Fitz.

1285
01:15:16,908 --> 01:15:19,119
It's the Little Guy I have to worry about.

1286
01:15:19,202 --> 01:15:20,704
You know what I'm saying.

1287
01:15:20,787 --> 01:15:21,788
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1288
01:15:21,871 --> 01:15:22,956
The Little Guy.

1289
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:24,416
- That's my worry.
- Yeah.

1290
01:15:26,084 --> 01:15:27,460
That son of a bitch.

1291
01:15:29,087 --> 01:15:32,006
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing. You're right.

1292
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:34,008
I'm right. Yeah.

1293
01:15:34,801 --> 01:15:36,821
- You're not perplexed, are you?
- Not at all. Not at all.

1294
01:15:36,845 --> 01:15:40,348
I mean, I told you how I felt about Fitz.
Pro. You know.

1295
01:15:40,432 --> 01:15:42,059
Yeah. Good, because sometimes I feel

1296
01:15:42,142 --> 01:15:45,103
I'm the only one
who sees right through that cocksucker.

1297
01:15:45,186 --> 01:15:46,396
J So lets raise a glass... J

1298
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:48,179
- He's a bad guy.
- He's a bad guy.

1299
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:51,609
J To the greatest guy

1300
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:57,532
J 560 is lucky enough to ever have &

1301
01:15:59,033 --> 01:16:01,911
J You're our boy

1302
01:16:01,995 --> 01:16:03,371
J Tony Pro &

1303
01:16:05,165 --> 01:16:07,250
J We're all yours &

1304
01:16:09,586 --> 01:16:12,297
the Little Guy was Tony Provenzano.

1305
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:14,883
They called him Tony Pro.

1306
01:16:14,966 --> 01:16:17,552
He was a capo in a big Jersey crew

1307
01:16:17,635 --> 01:16:20,096
and the president of the Local 560

1308
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:21,806
in Union City, New Jersey.

1309
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:35,945
<i>(Man singing) & He's the greatest guy</i>

1310
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:41,618
J 560 is lucky enough to ever have &

1311
01:16:41,701 --> 01:16:44,287
Tony! Tony! Tony!

1312
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:46,998
Tony! Tony! Tony!

1313
01:16:47,081 --> 01:16:48,750
Tony! Tony! Tony!

1314
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:52,170
Pro and Jimmy, they came up together

1315
01:16:52,253 --> 01:16:54,172
and they were close... for a while.

1316
01:16:54,756 --> 01:16:56,966
You "turl," you work,

1317
01:16:57,634 --> 01:17:00,094
while the corporation kings

1318
01:17:00,178 --> 01:17:02,222
and princes of industry,

1319
01:17:02,305 --> 01:17:04,307
with their vast expense accounts

1320
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:06,935
and salary and "luxurous” yachts,

1321
01:17:07,018 --> 01:17:10,522
have dedicated themselves
to our destruction.

1322
01:17:10,605 --> 01:17:12,482
Down on them!

1323
01:17:13,483 --> 01:17:16,277
/ didn't need nobody
to tell me about Tony Pro.

1324
01:17:16,361 --> 01:17:19,113
No. What did I need to know?
I knew enough.

1325
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,832
This is a man who had Sally Bugs strangle

1326
01:17:28,915 --> 01:17:31,000
Tony "Three Fingers" Castellito

1327
01:17:31,084 --> 01:17:34,712
Just because Three Fingers
was coming up big in the union.

1328
01:17:34,796 --> 01:17:37,131
And it was his own guy.
It was his own guy.

1329
01:17:54,524 --> 01:17:56,568
Tony Pro was so fucking worried

1330
01:17:56,651 --> 01:17:58,195
that this guy was gonna beat him out

1331
01:17:58,278 --> 01:18:00,655
that after he had Sally Bugs
strangle the guy,

1332
01:18:00,738 --> 01:18:03,700
he had Sally stick him
in a fucking tree shredder.

1333
01:18:03,783 --> 01:18:05,452
That way there'd be no competition,

1334
01:18:05,535 --> 01:18:06,703
not even from the grave.

1335
01:18:06,786 --> 01:18:08,162
He's out of control.

1336
01:18:08,705 --> 01:18:10,955
What are you gonna do
with a person like this?

1337
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:13,459
He's got a hand in everybody's pocket.

1338
01:18:13,543 --> 01:18:15,045
Shaking down the trucking companies.

1339
01:18:15,128 --> 01:18:16,296
Can you imagine that?

1340
01:18:16,379 --> 01:18:17,672
Threatening people.

1341
01:18:17,755 --> 01:18:20,300
I mean, you know,
you threaten people once in a while,

1342
01:18:20,383 --> 01:18:21,801
okay, I understand.

1343
01:18:21,885 --> 01:18:23,011
But all the time?

1344
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,431
It's drawing attention to us,
you understand?

1345
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:29,767
Guys like that give the unions a bad name.

1346
01:18:31,227 --> 01:18:32,645
Something's got to be done.

1347
01:18:33,354 --> 01:18:35,940
I mean it.
Something's gotta be done.

1348
01:18:36,649 --> 01:18:38,610
Tony being Tony...

1349
01:18:39,527 --> 01:18:41,196
that ain't... that ain't easy.
We can't...

1350
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:43,531
I don't mean that. I don't...

1351
01:18:43,615 --> 01:18:44,908
Not... Not that.

1352
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,409
Yeah, I'm just...

1353
01:18:46,492 --> 01:18:48,119
I'm just saying get working guys

1354
01:18:48,202 --> 01:18:50,705
who know the unions,
card-carrying Teamsters,

1355
01:18:50,788 --> 01:18:52,165
like you and me.

1356
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:54,083
Start running,

1357
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,668
take over some of the locals.

1358
01:18:56,377 --> 01:18:58,087
What do you think?

1359
01:18:58,171 --> 01:18:59,673
- He ain't gonna like that.
- Who?

1360
01:18:59,756 --> 01:19:01,883
Fuck him. Who the fuck is he?

1361
01:19:01,966 --> 01:19:03,259
He's a gangster.

1362
01:19:03,343 --> 01:19:05,428
I run the union, I'm the president.

1363
01:19:05,511 --> 01:19:06,888
So, I mean...

1364
01:19:06,971 --> 01:19:10,350
All I need is some guys
who know their ways around.

1365
01:19:11,059 --> 01:19:12,727
Know how to handle themselves, you know.

1366
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:13,811
That's all.

1367
01:19:14,896 --> 01:19:17,398
That's why I want you to run for president

1368
01:19:17,482 --> 01:19:18,983
of Local 326.

1369
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:24,489
You're like family to me, Frank.
You know.

1370
01:19:24,572 --> 01:19:25,865
You, Irene,

1371
01:19:26,449 --> 01:19:27,575
the girls.

1372
01:19:27,659 --> 01:19:28,660
The lovely Peggy.

1373
01:19:29,744 --> 01:19:31,788
But that's not why I'm doing this.

1374
01:19:31,871 --> 01:19:34,374
I'm not giving you anything
you didn't earn,

1375
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,376
you didn't deserve.

1376
01:19:37,835 --> 01:19:39,170
What do you think?

1377
01:19:40,797 --> 01:19:43,883
Um, I... I don't know what to say, Jimmy.

1378
01:19:43,967 --> 01:19:46,217
- I mean, um...
- Well, just say you'll do it.

1379
01:19:47,053 --> 01:19:48,554
That's all you got to say.

1380
01:19:49,138 --> 01:19:51,088
Plus, I can guarantee you're gonna win.

1381
01:19:52,141 --> 01:19:53,977
Ha! When you run for president...

1382
01:19:55,103 --> 01:19:57,522
of 326, you're gonna win.

1383
01:19:59,023 --> 01:20:00,149
I guarantee it.

1384
01:20:00,858 --> 01:20:03,111
Yeah, okay, I'll do it. Yeah.

1385
01:20:04,779 --> 01:20:05,863
You mean it?

1386
01:20:05,947 --> 01:20:08,157
Yeah, yeah. I'm... I'm honored.

1387
01:20:08,241 --> 01:20:10,994
I love you. I just love you, you know.
Come here.

1388
01:20:11,077 --> 01:20:12,662
I love you, man.

1389
01:20:12,745 --> 01:20:14,288
I can't tell ya.

1390
01:20:14,372 --> 01:20:15,373
Gee.

1391
01:20:15,456 --> 01:20:16,958
This is so good, you know.

1392
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:19,252
I feel like I can breathe again.

1393
01:20:19,335 --> 01:20:20,878
It's so funny. I...

1394
01:20:20,962 --> 01:20:22,046
Somehow I...

1395
01:20:23,256 --> 01:20:25,508
I don't know.
I thought you would've said no.

1396
01:20:27,093 --> 01:20:29,095
- Um...
- I'm glad you said yes.

1397
01:20:29,178 --> 01:20:30,471
I mean...

1398
01:20:31,431 --> 01:20:32,473
Frank...

1399
01:20:34,392 --> 01:20:37,478
You never reveal how you feel, you know.
It's hard to tell.

1400
01:20:38,104 --> 01:20:39,689
I'm honored, Jimmy. I don't know...

1401
01:20:39,772 --> 01:20:41,774
It's just I don't know what to... say,

1402
01:20:41,858 --> 01:20:43,158
you know, but I'm honored.

1403
01:20:44,402 --> 01:20:45,653
Well, that's good.

1404
01:20:47,488 --> 01:20:48,990
That makes me feel good.

1405
01:20:50,324 --> 01:20:51,826
I can breathe.

1406
01:20:52,869 --> 01:20:54,287
That's so great.

1407
01:20:55,955 --> 01:20:57,081
L...

1408
01:21:25,568 --> 01:21:28,529
What can I say?
I mean, I owe it all to Jimmy.

1409
01:21:28,613 --> 01:21:31,949
He took me out of a meat truck,
he gave me my start.

1410
01:21:32,033 --> 01:21:35,661
He gave me my first charter.
He gave me my first union.

1411
01:21:36,621 --> 01:21:38,289
- How are ya?
- Hey, how are you?

1412
01:21:38,372 --> 01:21:40,666
Frank Sheeran,
the new president of Union 326.

1413
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:43,211
- I wanted to introduce myself.
- Nice to meet ya.

1414
01:21:43,836 --> 01:21:45,463
- What's your name?
- My name's Al.

1415
01:21:45,546 --> 01:21:47,298
Al. Nice to meet ya, Al.

1416
01:21:47,381 --> 01:21:49,259
- A little something...
- No, no. Don't need it.

1417
01:21:49,342 --> 01:21:51,177
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1418
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:52,780
Just came here to say hello,
introduce myself.

1419
01:21:52,804 --> 01:21:54,597
You need anything,
just get in touch with me.

1420
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,724
- Okay? Yeah.
- You sure? Thank you.

1421
01:21:56,808 --> 01:21:59,977
So, hypothetically, if they can prove
that you stole from them,

1422
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:02,772
what they're gonna want are names, so...

1423
01:22:04,524 --> 01:22:07,777
Would you be willing to give up names
to keep from going to jail?

1424
01:22:08,402 --> 01:22:09,570
No.

1425
01:22:09,654 --> 01:22:11,989
Okay. So you got nothing to worry about.

1426
01:22:12,073 --> 01:22:15,451
- The lawyers will take care of it.
- Thank you, Mr. Sheeran.

1427
01:22:24,627 --> 01:22:28,673
The Interstate 80 West
through the rest of Pennsylvania,

1428
01:22:29,173 --> 01:22:33,469
and then we'd go across Ohio
all the way to Toledo,

1429
01:22:33,553 --> 01:22:37,098
and then we'd go 75 North to Detroit.

1430
01:22:38,057 --> 01:22:40,226
And wed still get there on time.

1431
01:22:43,229 --> 01:22:45,440
Your Honor,
my client had been advised by counsel

1432
01:22:45,523 --> 01:22:47,775
that it was perfectly legal for his wife

1433
01:22:47,859 --> 01:22:50,027
to be part owner of a trucking business.

1434
01:22:50,111 --> 01:22:53,281
Still, when the McClellan Committee
challenged its legality,

1435
01:22:53,364 --> 01:22:55,658
she withdrew from the company immediately.

1436
01:22:55,741 --> 01:22:57,910
That should be the end of the matter.

1437
01:22:58,494 --> 01:23:00,705
There had been not one indictment served

1438
01:23:00,788 --> 01:23:04,041
against my client
in 13 grand jury investigations.

1439
01:23:04,876 --> 01:23:07,753
Your Honor, this is an example of

1440
01:23:07,837 --> 01:23:10,047
a personal vendetta against my client,

1441
01:23:10,131 --> 01:23:13,718
against his family,
by a frustrated Justice Department

1442
01:23:13,801 --> 01:23:15,851
and the attorney general, Robert Kennedy.

1443
01:23:18,514 --> 01:23:20,183
Whoa!

1444
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:24,103
He's got a gun!

1445
01:23:24,812 --> 01:23:27,398
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1446
01:23:29,192 --> 01:23:30,642
Get that gun out of his hand!

1447
01:23:34,197 --> 01:23:35,239
Easy, boy.

1448
01:23:40,745 --> 01:23:42,663
That was not a real gun, was it?

1449
01:23:42,747 --> 01:23:44,207
How'd that gun get in?

1450
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,416
How'd it get in here?

1451
01:23:45,499 --> 01:23:47,084
It wasn't my fault!

1452
01:23:47,168 --> 01:23:48,377
I don't know!

1453
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:49,545
My Chuckie!

1454
01:23:49,629 --> 01:23:51,839
Hey, it's my son!

1455
01:23:51,923 --> 01:23:54,133
That's my kid. I raised this kid.

1456
01:23:54,217 --> 01:23:55,968
You see him? You see what he did?

1457
01:23:58,596 --> 01:23:59,680
Ill tell you this.

1458
01:23:59,764 --> 01:24:02,850
He shot at me,
and it was like a pellet or something.

1459
01:24:02,934 --> 01:24:05,019
I didn't feel it,
I just felt a little impact,

1460
01:24:05,102 --> 01:24:07,355
like I was shot not even with a BB gun.

1461
01:24:07,438 --> 01:24:09,190
Something even lighter.

1462
01:24:09,273 --> 01:24:10,441
But I charged him.

1463
01:24:10,524 --> 01:24:12,211
I charged him and so did Chuckie,
if you noticed.

1464
01:24:12,235 --> 01:24:13,653
I taught him well.

1465
01:24:13,736 --> 01:24:17,240
You charge a guy,
always charge a guy with a gun.

1466
01:24:17,323 --> 01:24:18,699
With a knife, you run away.

1467
01:24:18,783 --> 01:24:22,161
Run away from a knife.
So you charge with a gun,

1468
01:24:22,245 --> 01:24:23,830
- with a knife, you run.
- That's right.

1469
01:24:23,913 --> 01:24:25,957
Hey! I rhymed!

1470
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,145
I know it sounds crazy,
but I got a message from a higher power

1471
01:24:30,169 --> 01:24:32,255
- telling me to shoot Jimmy Hoffa.
- Come with me.

1472
01:24:32,338 --> 01:24:34,423
A lot of nuts in Nashville, Frank.

1473
01:24:34,507 --> 01:24:36,384
Come on down, Frank.

1474
01:24:36,467 --> 01:24:38,303
Yeah, I got one of them
with me now, you see.

1475
01:24:38,386 --> 01:24:39,637
Get down here, Frank.

1476
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,600
Eddie Partin, you know the guy
from Baton Rouge,

1477
01:24:41,639 --> 01:24:42,640
he's here with me.

1478
01:24:42,723 --> 01:24:43,951
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get right down.

1479
01:24:43,975 --> 01:24:45,726
Out of my way, boys. Come on.

1480
01:24:47,228 --> 01:24:48,437
Come on, come on.

1481
01:24:52,066 --> 01:24:53,359
Hey.

1482
01:24:53,442 --> 01:24:55,111
Did Mr. Brennan first say,

1483
01:24:55,194 --> 01:24:56,696
or do you remember him first saying

1484
01:24:56,779 --> 01:24:59,740
something about, say,
"I had to change the deal.

1485
01:24:59,824 --> 01:25:01,951
I have to cut Hoffa in on the new deal"?

1486
01:25:02,034 --> 01:25:04,954
Wasn't that like the chronology
of the whole thing?

1487
01:25:05,037 --> 01:25:07,373
I don't know he changed the deal,

1488
01:25:08,165 --> 01:25:10,668
but it was my understanding
over the telephone that Brennan

1489
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:12,211
was speaking for himself.

1490
01:25:12,295 --> 01:25:14,015
She's an angry woman.
That's an angry woman.

1491
01:25:14,046 --> 01:25:15,089
Yeah.

1492
01:25:15,172 --> 01:25:17,425
- She was a teacher I think.
- That's right.

1493
01:25:17,508 --> 01:25:19,135
What we're looking at is this one.

1494
01:25:19,218 --> 01:25:20,511
This one is not approachable.

1495
01:25:20,594 --> 01:25:22,096
No, she'd be a tough nut to crack.

1496
01:25:22,179 --> 01:25:23,598
There's a lot of family money there.

1497
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:25,308
Will hall, stop, and search

1498
01:25:25,391 --> 01:25:27,310
all ships bound for Cuba.

1499
01:25:27,393 --> 01:25:29,228
If the ships' captains do not stop,

1500
01:25:29,312 --> 01:25:30,980
<i>force will be used to stop them.</i>

1501
01:25:31,063 --> 01:25:32,523
If the ships do stop...

1502
01:25:32,606 --> 01:25:34,692
See, I think there's an in here...

1503
01:25:34,775 --> 01:25:37,737
Did you make this statement
to the grand jury? I'll read it for you.

1504
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:40,949
"Brennan came to me and said words
to the effect he's gonna go ahead..."

1505
01:25:41,032 --> 01:25:42,700
He's got a restaurant.

1506
01:25:42,783 --> 01:25:43,844
Did you look into violations?

1507
01:25:43,868 --> 01:25:45,262
Yeah.
I'd rather stick with the women.

1508
01:25:45,286 --> 01:25:47,622
- They're more approachable.
- Jimmy, thank you.

1509
01:25:47,705 --> 01:25:50,833
In Cuba of operational
medium-range missiles.

1510
01:25:50,916 --> 01:25:52,961
He added that if one
of the missiles is launched,

1511
01:25:53,044 --> 01:25:55,144
it would probably carry a nuclear warhead.

1512
01:25:55,713 --> 01:25:58,549
It could hit any spot
in the southeast United States,

1513
01:25:58,632 --> 01:25:59,967
south of Washington.

1514
01:26:00,509 --> 01:26:02,637
And that we would have no way
of intercepting it

1515
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,680
or Issuing a warning about it.

1516
01:26:04,764 --> 01:26:07,725
This one's married
to a state trooper named Plechette.

1517
01:26:07,808 --> 01:26:09,060
Ooh, that's good.

1518
01:26:09,894 --> 01:26:10,978
We know anyone?

1519
01:26:11,062 --> 01:26:14,565
Well, yeah, we got an ex-cop in the Local.

1520
01:26:14,648 --> 01:26:15,775
That's good.

1521
01:26:15,858 --> 01:26:18,208
All our forces
have been put on increased alert.

1522
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,509
Came to me and said words to the effect

1523
01:26:41,592 --> 01:26:44,553
he's gonna go ahead
and set up a company to lease trucks.

1524
01:26:44,637 --> 01:26:47,556
But later, he called me
on the phone and said quote,

1525
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:51,811
"I gotta change the deal
'cause I gotta cut Hoffa in on the deal."

1526
01:26:51,894 --> 01:26:53,104
Is that accurate, sir?

1527
01:26:53,187 --> 01:26:55,022
This one's another possibility.

1528
01:26:55,106 --> 01:26:57,108
- Wait.
- Well, she had a boyfriend,

1529
01:26:57,191 --> 01:26:59,485
she's seeing somebody else
while she's married.

1530
01:26:59,568 --> 01:27:01,862
So it could be, you know, could grab her,

1531
01:27:01,946 --> 01:27:03,048
- hold onto her.
- Yeah, but...

1532
01:27:03,072 --> 01:27:04,323
But this guy,

1533
01:27:04,407 --> 01:27:07,284
the construction business.
He has a couple of violations,

1534
01:27:07,368 --> 01:27:09,829
there's a lien on his house.

1535
01:27:09,912 --> 01:27:11,330
His car is unpaid.

1536
01:27:12,123 --> 01:27:15,251
That's good. Keep going.
Don't quit while you're ahead.

1537
01:27:22,383 --> 01:27:24,218
Thank you. See you, Big Eddie.

1538
01:27:24,301 --> 01:27:27,347
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

1539
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:29,557
- so help you God?
- I do.

1540
01:27:37,022 --> 01:27:39,775
Mr. King, you're a member of

1541
01:27:39,859 --> 01:27:43,112
the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, is that correct, sir?

1542
01:27:43,195 --> 01:27:46,740
I respectfully decline
to answer that under the,

1543
01:27:46,824 --> 01:27:49,577
protection afforded me by the...

1544
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:50,786
Fifth Amendment.

1545
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:52,430
I just asked if you're a Teamster, sir.

1546
01:27:52,496 --> 01:27:54,165
I respectfully decline to answer...

1547
01:27:54,248 --> 01:27:56,041
Okay. All right. Fine.

1548
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:58,044
I'm gonna show you
a photograph, all right?

1549
01:27:58,127 --> 01:28:00,671
- I respectfully decline to answer...
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait...

1550
01:28:00,754 --> 01:28:02,214
under the protection...

1551
01:28:02,298 --> 01:28:03,966
You haven't even seen the photograph yet.

1552
01:28:04,049 --> 01:28:05,927
Look at the photograph, wait a smidge,

1553
01:28:06,010 --> 01:28:08,929
-and then you can —
-I want to avail myself

1554
01:28:09,013 --> 01:28:13,225
of my right under the Constitution,
as I understand it.

1555
01:28:13,309 --> 01:28:17,229
- Jim, let him avail himself.
- Okay.

1556
01:28:23,652 --> 01:28:25,362
Yeah.

1557
01:28:25,446 --> 01:28:27,281
That King's the best.

1558
01:28:27,364 --> 01:28:29,825
He's the best. He's a good guy.

1559
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:31,452
You see him stand up to that jerk?

1560
01:28:31,535 --> 01:28:33,412
Yeah, yeah, I know.
He was great.

1561
01:28:33,496 --> 01:28:35,080
I love what he did.

1562
01:28:35,164 --> 01:28:37,250
They tried to get him,
they tried their best.

1563
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:39,210
- We need more like him.
- My God!

1564
01:28:40,669 --> 01:28:42,546
More details just arrived.

1565
01:28:44,173 --> 01:28:46,634
These details are not the same
as previously.

1566
01:28:46,717 --> 01:28:48,302
President Kennedy, shot today,

1567
01:28:48,385 --> 01:28:51,055
Just as his motorcade
left downtown Dallas.

1568
01:28:51,138 --> 01:28:52,306
Mrs. Kennedy jumped up

1569
01:28:52,389 --> 01:28:55,476
and grabbed Mr. Kennedy.
She called, "No!”

1570
01:28:55,559 --> 01:28:57,311
The motorcade sped on.

1571
01:28:58,103 --> 01:29:01,440
United Press says
that the wounds of President Kennedy

1572
01:29:01,524 --> 01:29:03,359
perhaps could be fatal.

1573
01:29:04,527 --> 01:29:07,196
Repeating a bulletin from CBS News.

1574
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:09,490
President Kennedy has been shot

1575
01:29:09,573 --> 01:29:12,701
by a would-be assassin in Dallas, Texas.

1576
01:29:12,785 --> 01:29:15,663
Stay tuned to CBS News
for further details.

1577
01:29:16,497 --> 01:29:17,498
What?

1578
01:29:20,209 --> 01:29:22,169
It takes more than an instant

1579
01:29:22,253 --> 01:29:24,338
to make a real cup of coffee.

1580
01:29:24,421 --> 01:29:28,259
That's why Nescafe has come up
with a new kind of coffee.

1581
01:29:28,342 --> 01:29:32,972
It's more than an instant.
It's new Minute Brew Nescafé.

1582
01:29:33,055 --> 01:29:34,056
Anybody can make a...

1583
01:29:34,139 --> 01:29:36,475
The flash, apparently official,

1584
01:29:36,559 --> 01:29:38,352
President Kennedy died

1585
01:29:38,435 --> 01:29:40,271
at 1.00 p.m...

1586
01:29:40,354 --> 01:29:42,106
central standard time,

1587
01:29:42,189 --> 01:29:44,984
two o'clock, eastern standard time,

1588
01:29:45,067 --> 01:29:47,069
some 38 minutes ago.

1589
01:29:52,491 --> 01:29:56,954
Vice President Johnson
has left the hospital in Dallas,

1590
01:29:57,037 --> 01:30:00,583
<i>but we do not know,
to where he has proceeded.</i>

1591
01:30:00,666 --> 01:30:04,545
Presumably, he will be taking
the oath of office shortly

1592
01:30:04,628 --> 01:30:08,924
and become the 36th
President of the United States.

1593
01:30:15,598 --> 01:30:18,892
Mr. Hoffa, will you be
attending the President's funeral?

1594
01:30:18,976 --> 01:30:19,977
I wasn't invited.

1595
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,580
You don't have to be invited.
A million Americans will be there.

1596
01:30:22,646 --> 01:30:23,897
Well...

1597
01:30:23,981 --> 01:30:25,733
I guess I'll have to check my schedule.

1598
01:30:25,816 --> 01:30:28,694
If you were to go and asked to speak,
what would you say?

1599
01:30:28,777 --> 01:30:30,237
I'd say,

1600
01:30:30,321 --> 01:30:32,656
Bobby Kennedy is just another lawyer now.

1601
01:30:37,745 --> 01:30:39,204
Son of a bitch.

1602
01:30:54,845 --> 01:30:56,445
Good, Eric. Thank you very much.

1603
01:31:06,649 --> 01:31:08,150
Jimmy was right.

1604
01:31:09,485 --> 01:31:10,486
Almost

1605
01:31:12,154 --> 01:31:14,198
That was the end of it with Bobby.

1606
01:31:15,115 --> 01:31:18,202
So much for him being
the attorney general. That was done.

1607
01:31:21,497 --> 01:31:24,458
Bobby's vendetta was over, with us.

1608
01:31:29,963 --> 01:31:31,465
Mr. Hoffa,

1609
01:31:32,424 --> 01:31:34,510
you stand here convicted
of having tampered

1610
01:31:34,593 --> 01:31:36,970
with the very soul of this nation.

1611
01:31:37,054 --> 01:31:40,641
But there was still
that jury thing in Nashville.

1612
01:31:40,724 --> 01:31:42,851
The soul of this nation, sir,

1613
01:31:42,935 --> 01:31:45,646
lies in its sacred processes of justice.

1614
01:31:46,188 --> 01:31:47,898
Justice must be done.

1615
01:31:47,981 --> 01:31:51,443
And for your wicked attempts
to corrupt these processes...

1616
01:31:52,736 --> 01:31:55,114
justice will be done on you.

1617
01:31:55,197 --> 01:31:57,574
We got him now.

1618
01:31:57,658 --> 01:31:58,659
We got him.

1619
01:31:58,742 --> 01:32:01,912
Ladies and gentlemen, we did it!

1620
01:32:19,221 --> 01:32:21,974
But Jimmy, you know, he had it all set up.

1621
01:32:22,057 --> 01:32:25,269
<i>Although you knew
it was supposed to look like Fitz</i>

1622
01:32:25,352 --> 01:32:27,229
was the one in charge.

1623
01:32:27,312 --> 01:32:30,607
He gave Fitz his orders
through Bill Bufalino and Allen Dorfman,

1624
01:32:30,691 --> 01:32:32,151
and they ran Jimmy's loans.

1625
01:32:32,234 --> 01:32:34,653
But things are good in here?
Everything is...

1626
01:32:34,737 --> 01:32:35,863
Everything's terrible.

1627
01:32:35,946 --> 01:32:37,507
You don't sleep at night
'cause you're afraid

1628
01:32:37,531 --> 01:32:39,241
someone's gonna knife you.

1629
01:32:39,324 --> 01:32:40,951
'Cause you look okay. You look okay.

1630
01:32:41,034 --> 01:32:43,370
Where's Fitz? He's late.

1631
01:32:43,454 --> 01:32:46,290
Yeah. Well, we were gonna meet him
in the front. He...

1632
01:32:46,373 --> 01:32:47,458
Meet him in the front?

1633
01:32:47,541 --> 01:32:48,542
Here he is, here he is.

1634
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:51,128
Where the hell have you been?
What are you doing here?

1635
01:32:51,211 --> 01:32:52,961
Why did you even come at all, Fitz?

1636
01:32:53,338 --> 01:32:54,649
You know, are you aware you're late?

1637
01:32:54,673 --> 01:32:56,484
That's all I want to know.
Do you know you're late?

1638
01:32:56,508 --> 01:32:59,470
I'm sorry I'm late, Jimmy,
but we got a lot going on.

1639
01:32:59,553 --> 01:33:02,139
I don't wanna hear that.
I wanna hear something concrete,

1640
01:33:02,222 --> 01:33:04,183
I wanna hear something straight on.

1641
01:33:04,266 --> 01:33:06,852
I'm just gonna ask you
to be a little more patient.

1642
01:33:06,935 --> 01:33:08,187
I think we're gonna have...

1643
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:10,481
I'm inside here.
I'm not gonna be too patient.

1644
01:33:10,564 --> 01:33:13,734
As much as Jimmy
was getting pissed off at Fitz,

1645
01:33:13,817 --> 01:33:15,819
everybody else liked him because

1646
01:33:15,903 --> 01:33:17,839
they could get anything out of him
that they wanted.

1647
01:33:17,863 --> 01:33:19,740
They couldn't do that with Jimmy.

1648
01:33:21,158 --> 01:33:23,911
<i>That's what happens
when you go away to college.</i>

1649
01:33:23,994 --> 01:33:25,204
How's that?

1650
01:33:27,164 --> 01:33:29,333
Jimmy's pissed off with Fitz.

1651
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:32,628
Fitz is okay. We like Fitz.

1652
01:33:32,711 --> 01:33:34,588
I'll tell you what the problem is.

1653
01:33:34,671 --> 01:33:36,673
Jimmy's got that ballbusting Dorfman

1654
01:33:36,757 --> 01:33:40,093
holding up loans that Fitz already okayed.

1655
01:33:41,428 --> 01:33:42,805
I hate that Dorfman.

1656
01:33:42,888 --> 01:33:45,057
He's such a pain-in-the-ass fucking Jew.

1657
01:33:48,644 --> 01:33:50,062
What do you want me to do?

1658
01:33:50,604 --> 01:33:52,648
No, not that. Not that.

1659
01:33:54,274 --> 01:33:58,028
What you gotta do is, you know,
put a firecracker up Dorfman's ass.

1660
01:33:58,737 --> 01:34:00,405
Fitz'll get the message.

1661
01:34:01,073 --> 01:34:02,825
He'll get the message.

1662
01:34:02,908 --> 01:34:05,108
I mean,
you can't do it to Fitz because if...

1663
01:34:05,661 --> 01:34:06,746
if you do it to that lush,

1664
01:34:06,829 --> 01:34:09,379
he'll run right to the Feds
and screw up everything.

1665
01:34:09,832 --> 01:34:11,083
But Dorfman...

1666
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:13,377
You gotta do it to Dorfman.

1667
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:53,876
<i>(Frank) Fitz... Fitz got the message.</i>

1668
01:34:57,129 --> 01:35:01,425
After that, anybody who wanted anything
from the pension fund, they got it.

1669
01:35:06,138 --> 01:35:08,516
The thing keeps comin' around.
Keeps comin' around.

1670
01:35:08,599 --> 01:35:09,933
What's goin' on?

1671
01:35:10,017 --> 01:35:12,102
- Fuck is this?
- Who's this guy?

1672
01:35:12,185 --> 01:35:13,312
Who let you in?

1673
01:35:15,731 --> 01:35:18,317
Mr. Provenzano.
I'm Agent DiGregorio of the FBI.

1674
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,128
I have a warrant for your arrest.
Please stand.

1675
01:35:20,152 --> 01:35:22,029
- Can I finish my hand?
- No, sir. Please stand.

1676
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,281
I had a bad fucking hand anyway.

1677
01:35:24,364 --> 01:35:25,616
Middle of the game.

1678
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:27,826
Join the club. Deal him in.

1679
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:28,911
Other arm, please.

1680
01:35:28,994 --> 01:35:30,746
- Can I get my bags?
- No, sir.

1681
01:35:30,829 --> 01:35:33,249
I got nothing in my pocket.
I got fucking shorts on here.

1682
01:35:33,332 --> 01:35:35,208
Look at this penguin over there?

1683
01:35:35,292 --> 01:35:37,336
Hey, Tony, will you get my bags?

1684
01:35:37,419 --> 01:35:38,659
Yeah, I'll get your bags, Tony.

1685
01:35:38,712 --> 01:35:40,505
This is like watchin' TV.

1686
01:35:41,715 --> 01:35:44,885
They got Pro for extortion
and gave him seven years.

1687
01:35:46,053 --> 01:35:48,138
And they sent him to Lewisburg prison.

1688
01:35:48,221 --> 01:35:49,571
So who does he end up with?

1689
01:35:50,432 --> 01:35:51,725
Jimmy.

1690
01:36:00,525 --> 01:36:01,818
Look at that.

1691
01:36:01,902 --> 01:36:03,570
Thank you, Pete.

1692
01:36:04,154 --> 01:36:05,572
Thank you, Pete.

1693
01:36:13,497 --> 01:36:16,541
I gotta talk to you about a problem
I got with my pension.

1694
01:36:19,795 --> 01:36:20,796
I know.

1695
01:36:21,672 --> 01:36:22,923
You know?

1696
01:36:23,924 --> 01:36:25,175
What do you know?

1697
01:36:26,301 --> 01:36:27,636
I know

1698
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:29,429
you got a million two

1699
01:36:29,513 --> 01:36:31,974
and, there's a problem with it.

1700
01:36:34,226 --> 01:36:35,894
So you'll look into it for me?

1701
01:36:36,603 --> 01:36:39,453
How am I going to look into it?
What am I gonna look into?

1702
01:36:39,731 --> 01:36:41,066
It is what it is.

1703
01:36:41,692 --> 01:36:42,818
Well, what is it?

1704
01:36:43,652 --> 01:36:44,653
You lost it.

1705
01:36:45,112 --> 01:36:48,573
You forfeited it when you came in here.
That's it.

1706
01:36:50,242 --> 01:36:52,160
So is yours forfeited too?

1707
01:36:52,244 --> 01:36:53,245
No.

1708
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:58,959
Let me get this straight.
So yours is still there,

1709
01:36:59,042 --> 01:37:01,128
your million five, whatever it is,

1710
01:37:01,211 --> 01:37:02,587
but mine's gone?

1711
01:37:03,714 --> 01:37:05,799
Yeah. Mine's still there.

1712
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,303
But we're both sitting here.

1713
01:37:10,387 --> 01:37:12,764
We're both sitting here. That's right.

1714
01:37:12,848 --> 01:37:15,225
Only we're sitting here
for different things.

1715
01:37:16,018 --> 01:37:18,311
You're sitting here for extortion.

1716
01:37:18,395 --> 01:37:20,689
I'm sitting here for fraud.

1717
01:37:21,273 --> 01:37:24,317
- So?
- So? So there's a difference.

1718
01:37:24,401 --> 01:37:25,527
What's the difference?

1719
01:37:28,739 --> 01:37:31,366
I didn't threaten anybody, you did.

1720
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:33,201
So what? That makes no sense.

1721
01:37:33,285 --> 01:37:34,495
What do you mean? It does.

1722
01:37:34,578 --> 01:37:36,372
No, it doesn't. I don't want a debate.

1723
01:37:36,455 --> 01:37:38,874
- Think about it.
- I'm thinking about it, Jimmy.

1724
01:37:38,957 --> 01:37:40,292
No, don't fuck with me, Jimmy.

1725
01:37:40,375 --> 01:37:41,835
Just do something about it.

1726
01:37:46,757 --> 01:37:48,676
What do you mean, "do something about it"?

1727
01:37:48,759 --> 01:37:49,760
What am I gonna do?

1728
01:37:49,843 --> 01:37:51,487
Come on,
there's always something you can do.

1729
01:37:51,511 --> 01:37:52,721
No. It's federal law.

1730
01:37:52,804 --> 01:37:54,473
- I don't care.
- You don't care?

1731
01:37:54,556 --> 01:37:56,433
No, you can still do something about it.

1732
01:37:56,516 --> 01:37:58,352
There's nothing I can do.
What can I do?

1733
01:37:58,435 --> 01:38:00,062
You can get my fucking money.

1734
01:38:00,145 --> 01:38:01,146
How?

1735
01:38:01,229 --> 01:38:02,439
- Some other way.
- What way?

1736
01:38:02,522 --> 01:38:03,899
The same way you got your money.

1737
01:38:03,982 --> 01:38:06,026
Shh. Lower your fucking voice.

1738
01:38:06,902 --> 01:38:08,529
You telling me to lower my voice?

1739
01:38:08,612 --> 01:38:09,714
I'm tellin' you to lower
your fucking voice.

1740
01:38:09,738 --> 01:38:10,906
Cocksucker.

1741
01:38:10,989 --> 01:38:12,425
- Don't call me a cocksucker.
- Fuck you.

1742
01:38:12,449 --> 01:38:13,950
Don't you fucking dare.

1743
01:38:15,243 --> 01:38:16,995
Look, you're here for fraud.

1744
01:38:17,079 --> 01:38:18,664
- You stole money.
- I stole money?

1745
01:38:18,747 --> 01:38:19,748
Yeah, I stole money.

1746
01:38:19,831 --> 01:38:21,931
Okay, fine, in a different way, but still,

1747
01:38:22,084 --> 01:38:24,044
I want what I'm fucking owed.

1748
01:38:25,587 --> 01:38:27,255
You people. You people.

1749
01:38:27,339 --> 01:38:28,799
- What did you say?
- My God!

1750
01:38:28,882 --> 01:38:30,926
- What did you say?
- Come on, what I said.

1751
01:38:31,009 --> 01:38:32,427
What the fuck did I say?

1752
01:38:32,511 --> 01:38:33,780
"You people." You said "You people.”

1753
01:38:33,804 --> 01:38:35,639
What does that fucking mean, "You people"?

1754
01:38:35,722 --> 01:38:37,057
I'm done

1755
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,850
talking about this.

1756
01:38:39,518 --> 01:38:41,144
- "You people"?
- I'm done!

1757
01:38:41,228 --> 01:38:43,022
You're done?
I'll rip your fucking head off!

1758
01:38:43,105 --> 01:38:44,856
- Fucking piece of shit!
- Hey!

1759
01:38:48,944 --> 01:38:50,362
I'll fucking Kill you!

1760
01:38:50,445 --> 01:38:53,240
I'll fucking kill you. Motherfucker!

1761
01:38:53,323 --> 01:38:54,366
What the fuck...

1762
01:38:59,704 --> 01:39:02,582
Right then, you knew
it was all gonna fall apart.

1763
01:39:32,529 --> 01:39:34,364
/ can't believe that crazy bastard

1764
01:39:34,447 --> 01:39:35,699
thought he could do that

1765
01:39:35,782 --> 01:39:38,910
right there at Columbus Circle,
in front of 5,000 people

1766
01:39:38,994 --> 01:39:40,328
and get away with it.

1767
01:39:40,412 --> 01:39:43,206
I can't believe it.
That is not right, Frankie.

1768
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,374
That is not right.

1769
01:39:44,457 --> 01:39:46,960
That is a total piece of shit.

1770
01:39:47,586 --> 01:39:49,546
That's a piece of shit.

1771
01:39:49,629 --> 01:39:51,799
There's only one guy
who would have the balls,

1772
01:39:51,882 --> 01:39:54,759
<i>the nerve, the audacity to do that.</i>

1773
01:40:03,977 --> 01:40:06,938
He was known Downtown as "Joey the Blond,"

1774
01:40:07,022 --> 01:40:09,691
but everybody, especially the newspapers,

1775
01:40:09,774 --> 01:40:12,027
called him "Crazy Joe."

1776
01:40:13,069 --> 01:40:14,070
shall be the truth,

1777
01:40:14,154 --> 01:40:16,907
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1778
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:18,617
- I do.
- Be seated.

1779
01:40:21,328 --> 01:40:23,788
Mr. Gallo, do you have
an opening statement?

1780
01:40:25,498 --> 01:40:26,499
Yeah.

1781
01:40:29,294 --> 01:40:31,421
This carpet would be great
for a crap game.

1782
01:40:35,592 --> 01:40:37,135
Russ was right.

1783
01:40:37,219 --> 01:40:40,139
I mean, who the hell else runs around
with show business people like that,

1784
01:40:40,222 --> 01:40:42,891
getting his picture taken
in the papers all the time,

1785
01:40:42,974 --> 01:40:45,894
drawing attention to himself
and everybody. What is that?

1786
01:40:46,519 --> 01:40:49,022
Who does he think he is, Erroll Flynn?

1787
01:40:49,105 --> 01:40:51,274
He went against everything and everybody.

1788
01:40:51,358 --> 01:40:52,859
Just didn't give a shit.

1789
01:40:52,943 --> 01:40:55,528
And, growing up,
he kidnapped his own bosses.

1790
01:40:55,612 --> 01:40:57,406
I don't know how he got away with that.

1791
01:40:57,489 --> 01:41:00,450
You don't get away with that.
You do that, you die.

1792
01:41:00,533 --> 01:41:01,618
That simple.

1793
01:41:01,701 --> 01:41:03,161
When he went away to the can,

1794
01:41:03,245 --> 01:41:06,039
he recruited black guys
instead of his own kind.

1795
01:41:06,122 --> 01:41:08,125
And when he got out,
nobody knew what he was doing,

1796
01:41:08,208 --> 01:41:09,268
or who he was doing with it.

1797
01:41:09,292 --> 01:41:11,942
We didn't know what the hell
was going on. Nobody did.

1798
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:14,006
And if you don't like what he's doing,

1799
01:41:14,089 --> 01:41:15,507
and you say something,

1800
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:17,425
then you see what happens.

1801
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:48,081
Who does something like that?
Who does things like that?

1802
01:41:48,164 --> 01:41:50,083
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

1803
01:41:51,376 --> 01:41:52,836
This disgraziato.

1804
01:41:52,919 --> 01:41:55,297
Him and Oswald. Two of a kind.

1805
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:57,466
At least in Dallas,
the kids weren't there.

1806
01:41:57,549 --> 01:41:58,925
It was just Jackie.

1807
01:41:59,009 --> 01:42:01,469
Joey, your doctor called.
You died an hour ago.

1808
01:42:03,263 --> 01:42:04,973
You a Jewish fellow?

1809
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:07,142
Would you like to be?

1810
01:42:07,225 --> 01:42:09,603
Don't worry about the operation.
We don't do that no more.

1811
01:42:09,686 --> 01:42:11,021
We freeze it.

1812
01:42:11,521 --> 01:42:13,148
And you stand there and don't do anything

1813
01:42:13,231 --> 01:42:15,150
and a Mexican broad
comes over with a wet rock.

1814
01:42:15,233 --> 01:42:16,693
Thwack!

1815
01:42:16,776 --> 01:42:19,112
See, it's okay to laugh.
I make fun of everybody.

1816
01:42:19,195 --> 01:42:21,948
That's why God put us on this earth,
to laugh.

1817
01:42:22,032 --> 01:42:23,283
I work everyone.

1818
01:42:23,366 --> 01:42:25,577
I make fun of blacks, I make fun of Jews.

1819
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:27,912
I work Gypsies, I work Italians.

1820
01:42:27,996 --> 01:42:29,748
Well, not those Italians.

1821
01:42:29,831 --> 01:42:31,583
No, no, no, no!

1822
01:42:31,666 --> 01:42:34,085
It's okay, Joey.
I got the money. Don't shoot.

1823
01:42:36,171 --> 01:42:37,380
I was told today,

1824
01:42:37,464 --> 01:42:39,924
"Be very careful about what you say."

1825
01:42:40,008 --> 01:42:43,178
But, all kidding aside,
happy birthday, Joey.

1826
01:42:54,314 --> 01:42:55,398
Hey, Russ.

1827
01:42:56,858 --> 01:42:59,194
Hey. What are you doing with that?

1828
01:43:02,155 --> 01:43:04,366
You really believe
in that bullshit league?

1829
01:43:05,450 --> 01:43:07,243
Well, it's not that.

1830
01:43:07,327 --> 01:43:08,536
It's Italian.

1831
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:09,954
Joey. Joey.

1832
01:43:10,038 --> 01:43:11,078
- What did I say?
- No, no.

1833
01:43:11,122 --> 01:43:13,222
- What did I say?
- Joey, Joey. Joey. Joey.

1834
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:14,626
Now, listen.

1835
01:43:15,835 --> 01:43:18,395
You can't say that stuff like that here.
Okay? You can't do that.

1836
01:43:18,463 --> 01:43:20,358
Why not? Rickles is the only one
who can make jokes?

1837
01:43:20,382 --> 01:43:21,549
The man's a boss.

1838
01:43:21,633 --> 01:43:24,278
So I'm a boss. He's a boss.
We're all supposed to be brothers, right?

1839
01:43:24,302 --> 01:43:26,947
I know you're a boss. I know, but we
don't wanna have a beef now. Okay?

1840
01:43:26,971 --> 01:43:29,099
- We're brothers, right?
- That's right, brothers.

1841
01:43:29,182 --> 01:43:30,851
- We're brothers?
- You're brothers.

1842
01:43:30,934 --> 01:43:32,578
- We're brothers.
- I'm not arguing with you.

1843
01:43:32,602 --> 01:43:33,687
Everybody's a brother.

1844
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:35,539
That's right, you're a brother.
You're his brother.

1845
01:43:35,563 --> 01:43:36,857
I'm not, but you guys are.

1846
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:38,900
So that's why
I would like it if you just...

1847
01:43:38,983 --> 01:43:39,984
- All right.
- Okay?

1848
01:43:40,068 --> 01:43:41,570
- We're brothers?
- You're brothers.

1849
01:43:41,653 --> 01:43:43,363
Yeah. It's my birthday.

1850
01:43:43,446 --> 01:43:44,781
Happy birthday.

1851
01:43:44,864 --> 01:43:46,241
Happy birthday.

1852
01:43:48,243 --> 01:43:50,203
Get the fuck out of here.

1853
01:44:11,683 --> 01:44:13,601
Now, for something like this,

1854
01:44:13,685 --> 01:44:15,603
you're gonna need two guns.

1855
01:44:15,687 --> 01:44:18,231
The one you're gonna use and a backup.

1856
01:44:19,023 --> 01:44:22,360
You want something with more
stopping power than a .22.

1857
01:44:27,991 --> 01:44:30,034
You definitely don't want a silencer.

1858
01:44:30,118 --> 01:44:33,121
<i>You want to make a lot of noise
to make the witnesses run away</i>

1859
01:44:33,204 --> 01:44:35,104
So they ain't gonna be looking at you.

1860
01:44:37,876 --> 01:44:39,878
But not the noise a .45 makes

1861
01:44:39,961 --> 01:44:41,505
cause that makes too much noise,

1862
01:44:41,588 --> 01:44:44,338
and a patrol car can hear it
a few blocks away at least.

1863
01:44:48,011 --> 01:44:51,931
The cops call a .32 a woman's gun
because it's easier to handle

1864
01:44:52,015 --> 01:44:54,017
and don't do the damage a .38 does,

1865
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:56,519
but, you know, it does enough.

1866
01:45:04,027 --> 01:45:08,448
/t would be late,
so the tourists from Idaho

1867
01:45:08,531 --> 01:45:10,533
wouldn't be there.
They'd be in bed.

1868
01:45:10,617 --> 01:45:12,619
And him being down there in Little Italy,

1869
01:45:12,702 --> 01:45:15,705
maybe he'd be more comfortable,
more relaxed.

1870
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:20,084
<i>It was his birthday
so he'd be there with his wife</i>

1871
01:45:20,168 --> 01:45:22,462
and his kid which, in this case,

1872
01:45:22,545 --> 01:45:24,797
that's good because that's the point.

1873
01:45:24,881 --> 01:45:26,841
They should have to see what it's like.

1874
01:45:28,718 --> 01:45:30,595
<i>He'd already been drinking,</i>

1875
01:45:30,678 --> 01:45:32,628
which would have slowed him down a lot.

1876
01:45:33,848 --> 01:45:35,183
His bodyguard would be with him

1877
01:45:35,266 --> 01:45:37,102
and Joey himself could be carrying, too,

1878
01:45:37,185 --> 01:45:40,313
but then the piece would be
in his wife's purse probably.

1879
01:45:46,653 --> 01:45:49,364
You never got a lot of advance notice.

1880
01:45:49,948 --> 01:45:52,033
All you knew was your part of it.

1881
01:45:54,077 --> 01:45:57,080
John the Redhead knew only one thing:

1882
01:45:57,163 --> 01:45:59,040
he was gonna drop me off,

1883
01:45:59,123 --> 01:46:02,126
circle the block and pick me up.

1884
01:46:10,301 --> 01:46:12,762
You wanna take out the bodyguard first.

1885
01:46:12,845 --> 01:46:15,807
Not kill him.
Don't kill him, just disable him.

1886
01:46:16,391 --> 01:46:17,767
You got no argument with him,

1887
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:20,395
so, not in the face or the chest.

1888
01:46:21,854 --> 01:46:24,566
Sometimes, with something like this,

1889
01:46:24,649 --> 01:46:27,151
<i>you might want to go
to the bathroom first.</i>

1890
01:46:28,069 --> 01:46:30,780
<i>It gives you a chance to make sure
nobody followed you in.</i>

1891
01:46:30,863 --> 01:46:32,299
It also gives you a chance to make sure

1892
01:46:32,323 --> 01:46:34,826
nobody is in the bathroom
you have to worry about.

1893
01:46:35,410 --> 01:46:37,704
It also gives you a chance
to go to the bathroom.

1894
01:46:37,787 --> 01:46:39,539
You don't want to be uncomfortable.

1895
01:46:40,164 --> 01:46:43,418
But I went before,
and in a place this small, this late,

1896
01:46:43,501 --> 01:46:45,545
you might as well just get to work.

1897
01:46:45,628 --> 01:46:46,922
We need more wine, all right?

1898
01:46:47,005 --> 01:46:49,048
Hey, Tommy, some more wine.

1899
01:46:49,132 --> 01:46:50,133
So how about after?

1900
01:46:50,216 --> 01:46:51,926
- Cake, cake, cake!
- Not yet.

1901
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:53,762
You're not even done eating the meal yet.

1902
01:46:53,845 --> 01:46:56,097
You want the cake?
Come on, you can't do that.

1903
01:46:59,475 --> 01:47:00,476
Shit!

1904
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,270
Fuck! Fuck!

1905
01:47:36,971 --> 01:47:38,890
/t happened in New Yorks Little Italy,

1906
01:47:38,973 --> 01:47:42,310
<i>an area rumored to be neutral territory
among mobsters.</i>

1907
01:47:42,393 --> 01:47:43,519
After the killing,

1908
01:47:43,603 --> 01:47:45,772
police found several guns
and some fingerprints

1909
01:47:45,855 --> 01:47:47,649
which they were tracing today.

1910
01:47:47,732 --> 01:47:49,108
Joseph "Crazy Joe" Gallo

1911
01:47:49,192 --> 01:47:51,569
had come
lo the intimate seafood restaurant

1912
01:47:51,653 --> 01:47:53,363
to cap an evening of celebration

1913
01:47:53,446 --> 01:47:55,240
with his new bride of less than a month,

1914
01:47:55,323 --> 01:47:58,034
and his 11-year-old daughter
by a previous marriage.

1915
01:47:58,117 --> 01:48:01,996
They were, celebrating
Joe's 47th birthday.

1916
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:04,749
<i>They had been to a nightclub
early in the evening.</i>

1917
01:48:04,832 --> 01:48:09,128
They were sitting at a rear table,
this group of six people,

1918
01:48:09,712 --> 01:48:10,963
when a...

1919
01:48:11,798 --> 01:48:12,799
a man walked in

1920
01:48:12,882 --> 01:48:16,427
from the back door, and he walked up,

1921
01:48:16,511 --> 01:48:20,139
lo the side of the table.
He fired three shots.

1922
01:48:20,223 --> 01:48:21,974
He hit Joe twice

1923
01:48:22,058 --> 01:48:23,827
- and he hit his bodyguard...
- Peggy, let's go.

1924
01:48:23,851 --> 01:48:26,062
Pete the Greek, one time.

1925
01:48:26,145 --> 01:48:28,648
There was a total of 14 shots fired.

1926
01:48:28,731 --> 01:48:29,732
Peggy, come on.

1927
01:48:30,358 --> 01:48:32,443
It's quiet here on President Street,

1928
01:48:32,527 --> 01:48:33,861
Joey Gallo's turf.

1929
01:48:34,570 --> 01:48:36,030
In fact, it's too quiet.

1930
01:48:36,698 --> 01:48:37,699
Out here in Brooklyn,

1931
01:48:37,782 --> 01:48:39,242
Joey Gallo was a hero.

1932
01:48:39,325 --> 01:48:42,995
Speculation has it
that his death may start a gang war,

1933
01:48:43,079 --> 01:48:44,956
If it hasn't already begun.

1934
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:21,159
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- You too, Mikey.

1935
01:49:21,242 --> 01:49:22,827
Take good care, Jimmy.

1936
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:24,329
If I don't see you again, hello.

1937
01:49:24,412 --> 01:49:27,665
Four years later and that
half a million dollars under the table

1938
01:49:27,749 --> 01:49:29,667
<i>to Nixon's reelection committee,</i>

1939
01:49:29,751 --> 01:49:31,669
Jimmy finally got what he wanted.

1940
01:49:31,753 --> 01:49:33,379
Sorry, but I won't be back.

1941
01:49:33,463 --> 01:49:36,632
A presidential pardon and his parole.

1942
01:49:36,716 --> 01:49:38,342
Jimmy!

1943
01:49:38,426 --> 01:49:39,611
What are you gonna do now, Jimmy?

1944
01:49:39,635 --> 01:49:42,972
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do is register

1945
01:49:43,055 --> 01:49:44,641
with the Federal Probation Office,

1946
01:49:44,724 --> 01:49:49,020
and then I'm going down to Florida
with my wife to get some sun.

1947
01:49:49,103 --> 01:49:50,105
Any plans after that?

1948
01:49:50,188 --> 01:49:53,024
Yeah, I'm gonna take back
control of my union.

1949
01:49:53,107 --> 01:49:54,776
How're you gonna do that, Jimmy?

1950
01:49:56,068 --> 01:49:58,697
- How do you like Fitz running against you?
- I don't.

1951
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:00,699
What was it like
being locked up all that time?

1952
01:50:00,782 --> 01:50:02,532
It was wonderful. Had a great time.

1953
01:50:04,076 --> 01:50:07,622
The first thing I did was,
I picked up some chili dogs from Lum's,

1954
01:50:07,705 --> 01:50:09,916
which Jimmy loved
almost as much as ice cream.

1955
01:50:09,999 --> 01:50:13,628
A consultant to President Richard Nixon's
reelection campaign committee...

1956
01:50:13,711 --> 01:50:15,963
The secret is they steam them in beer.

1957
01:50:16,047 --> 01:50:18,132
There ain't a better hot dog in America.

1958
01:50:18,216 --> 01:50:22,303
Police say McCord and his accomplices
brought electronic listening devices

1959
01:50:22,386 --> 01:50:25,264
with them and had removed
two ceiling panels...

1960
01:50:25,348 --> 01:50:27,892
while installing eavesdropping equipment

1961
01:50:27,975 --> 01:50:29,825
at the Democratic National Committee.

1962
01:50:30,728 --> 01:50:33,773
Look at this. He's got the balls
to run for President of the Teamsters.

1963
01:50:33,856 --> 01:50:36,400
Look at this.
And Tony Pro giving him an award.

1964
01:50:36,484 --> 01:50:38,069
This fuck... Do you believe it?

1965
01:50:38,152 --> 01:50:40,738
Look, Fitz is very popular
with certain people.

1966
01:50:40,822 --> 01:50:42,702
Of course he's popular.
Who wouldn't be popular?

1967
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:45,201
He loans money to every goombah who asks.

1968
01:50:45,284 --> 01:50:48,579
That's why Tony's behind him.
He's given Fitz all his votes.

1969
01:50:48,663 --> 01:50:50,832
You got great support
from most of the union.

1970
01:50:50,915 --> 01:50:54,002
All you need is Tony Pro's voters
in the Northeast, and you can win.

1971
01:50:54,085 --> 01:50:56,212
- You sure you don't want one of these?
- No, thank you.

1972
01:50:56,295 --> 01:51:00,216
I just can't believe
I gotta go to Tony Pro to get votes.

1973
01:51:00,299 --> 01:51:01,300
What is that?

1974
01:51:03,219 --> 01:51:05,721
Tony has Fitz in his pocket, Jimmy.

1975
01:51:05,805 --> 01:51:07,348
Wise guys don't run the union.

1976
01:51:07,431 --> 01:51:08,641
With Fitz, they do.

1977
01:51:09,725 --> 01:51:12,270
Jimmy, listen,
as soon as you're back as president,

1978
01:51:12,353 --> 01:51:13,413
you can do anything you want to.

1979
01:51:13,437 --> 01:51:15,231
You can fire anybody you want to.

1980
01:51:15,314 --> 01:51:17,275
You can even fire Tony Pro.

1981
01:51:17,358 --> 01:51:18,442
Whoa.

1982
01:51:18,526 --> 01:51:21,362
You could stand over him,
watch him clear out his desk.

1983
01:51:21,445 --> 01:51:23,406
You could strip-search the guy.

1984
01:51:24,198 --> 01:51:26,242
Make sure he doesn't walk off
with a paper clip.

1985
01:51:26,325 --> 01:51:28,411
Ooh, yes. See that? Did you hear that?

1986
01:51:30,037 --> 01:51:31,706
See, everybody thinks Jo's the nice one

1987
01:51:31,789 --> 01:51:33,499
and I'm the bad guy.

1988
01:51:33,583 --> 01:51:34,834
But it's opposite.

1989
01:51:35,585 --> 01:51:38,296
She's the killer and I'm the sweetheart.

1990
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:42,008
Now I gotta make peace
with the cocksucker.

1991
01:51:42,091 --> 01:51:44,886
I want to make up with you.

1992
01:51:45,595 --> 01:51:48,264
I need you to endorse me. Please, Tony.

1993
01:51:48,347 --> 01:51:49,640
Please.

1994
01:51:49,724 --> 01:51:50,975
Fucking...

1995
01:51:51,058 --> 01:51:53,436
I'm not gonna get through this.

1996
01:51:53,519 --> 01:51:55,563
You gotta talk to him, that's all.
Just...

1997
01:51:55,646 --> 01:51:57,446
- You gotta deal with it.
- Let the chips fall

1998
01:51:57,481 --> 01:51:59,817
- where they may.
- He is a cocksucker, though.

1999
01:52:00,860 --> 01:52:02,987
If I sat down with him,
would you come along?

2000
01:52:03,070 --> 01:52:04,381
What are you talking about?
Of course.

2001
01:52:04,405 --> 01:52:05,955
How am I not gonna go with you?

2002
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:16,626
Fuck it. Let's go.

2003
01:52:16,709 --> 01:52:18,502
Jimmy, Jimmy. Give it a chance.

2004
01:52:18,586 --> 01:52:20,786
Give it a chance.
Give it a few more minutes.

2005
01:52:22,632 --> 01:52:24,008
-Just —
-This isn't right.

2006
01:52:24,091 --> 01:52:25,885
This isn't right. You don't do this.

2007
01:52:25,968 --> 01:52:27,929
You don't keep a man waiting.

2008
01:52:28,012 --> 01:52:29,263
I know. I know.

2009
01:52:30,514 --> 01:52:32,433
The only time you do

2010
01:52:32,516 --> 01:52:34,644
is when you want to say something.

2011
01:52:35,353 --> 01:52:38,064
- I know.
- When you want to say "Fuck you."

2012
01:52:38,147 --> 01:52:39,649
That's the only time.

2013
01:52:39,732 --> 01:52:41,692
Here they are.

2014
01:52:43,903 --> 01:52:46,113
Can you believe this weather, Frank?

2015
01:52:46,197 --> 01:52:49,283
It's 85 degrees outside. Perfect.

2016
01:52:49,367 --> 01:52:51,786
- Hey, Tony Jack.
- Jimmy.

2017
01:52:51,869 --> 01:52:55,206
People freezing to death
in New York and look at us?

2018
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:58,209
Why we don't live here all year round
is what I wanna know.

2019
01:52:58,292 --> 01:53:00,127
Beautiful.

2020
01:53:00,211 --> 01:53:02,296
- It's summer.
- What?

2021
01:53:03,089 --> 01:53:04,090
It's summer.

2022
01:53:05,216 --> 01:53:07,385
People aren't freezing to death
in New York.

2023
01:53:08,803 --> 01:53:09,971
It's summer.

2024
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:14,326
In my mind,
it's always eight degrees in New York.

2025
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:15,476
I'm making a point.

2026
01:53:16,143 --> 01:53:17,353
You're making a point.

2027
01:53:17,937 --> 01:53:19,689
Making a point dressing like that?

2028
01:53:20,398 --> 01:53:22,198
Is that how you dress for a meeting?

2029
01:53:23,442 --> 01:53:26,862
This is how you dress in Florida?
In a suit?

2030
01:53:26,946 --> 01:53:28,197
For a meeting?

2031
01:53:28,906 --> 01:53:32,410
Anywhere.
Florida, Timbuktu, I dress in a suit.

2032
01:53:32,493 --> 01:53:33,661
For a meetin'.

2033
01:53:34,412 --> 01:53:36,122
- And you're late.
- What?

2034
01:53:37,206 --> 01:53:38,207
You're late.

2035
01:53:40,376 --> 01:53:42,628
- Yeah, there was traffic.
- Yes, traffic.

2036
01:53:42,712 --> 01:53:44,797
Wasn't there traffic?

2037
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,316
- You give me traffic?
- There was traffic.

2038
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:47,425
What do you want from us?

2039
01:53:47,508 --> 01:53:48,788
It was bumper to fuckin' bumper.

2040
01:53:48,843 --> 01:53:50,720
Yeah, yeah. No, it's bad, you know?

2041
01:53:50,803 --> 01:53:51,804
Traffic.

2042
01:53:52,638 --> 01:53:55,683
I never waited for anyone who was late

2043
01:53:56,308 --> 01:53:58,853
more than ten minutes in my life.

2044
01:53:59,353 --> 01:54:01,188
I'd say fifteen. Fifteen's right.

2045
01:54:01,272 --> 01:54:02,398
No, ten.

2046
01:54:03,691 --> 01:54:05,360
I don't think so, ten's not enough.

2047
01:54:05,443 --> 01:54:07,236
You have to take traffic into account.

2048
01:54:07,319 --> 01:54:10,156
That's what I'm doing.
I'm taking traffic into account.

2049
01:54:10,948 --> 01:54:11,949
That's why it's ten.

2050
01:54:12,033 --> 01:54:14,035
- I still say 15.
- No, ten.

2051
01:54:15,077 --> 01:54:17,121
Fine. We disagree on that.

2052
01:54:17,204 --> 01:54:18,748
How about twelve and a half minutes?

2053
01:54:18,831 --> 01:54:20,124
There we go, 12.5.

2054
01:54:20,207 --> 01:54:22,334
The middle. Right in the middle.
Beautiful.

2055
01:54:22,418 --> 01:54:24,003
More than ten...

2056
01:54:25,171 --> 01:54:26,422
you're saying something.

2057
01:54:27,673 --> 01:54:29,673
- You saying something to me?
- I'm here.

2058
01:54:30,259 --> 01:54:32,428
It says what it says.

2059
01:54:33,971 --> 01:54:35,556
So there it is.

2060
01:54:37,099 --> 01:54:38,349
Where do we go from here?

2061
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:42,480
Well, what can I do for you?

2062
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:47,234
I want you...

2063
01:54:49,445 --> 01:54:50,613
I...

2064
01:54:51,572 --> 01:54:53,157
I want you to endorse me...

2065
01:54:55,242 --> 01:54:57,369
for you know what.

2066
01:54:57,453 --> 01:55:00,790
Before we get to that,
let's straighten that other thing up.

2067
01:55:00,873 --> 01:55:03,042
No. The other thing
is none of my business.

2068
01:55:03,125 --> 01:55:05,461
I can't do anything about your pension.

2069
01:55:05,544 --> 01:55:09,090
I can't. Not with Fitz in there.
Fitz is in there, you know.

2070
01:55:09,173 --> 01:55:10,341
- You go to Fitz.
- I did.

2071
01:55:10,424 --> 01:55:11,676
- He'll help you out.
- I did.

2072
01:55:11,759 --> 01:55:14,012
He said he'll take care of it,
no questions asked.

2073
01:55:14,095 --> 01:55:16,013
You wouldn't do that but he will.

2074
01:55:16,722 --> 01:55:18,224
I meant the other thing.

2075
01:55:20,101 --> 01:55:21,102
What other thing?

2076
01:55:21,185 --> 01:55:22,561
You know.

2077
01:55:22,645 --> 01:55:24,021
I don't know.

2078
01:55:24,105 --> 01:55:25,397
Your apology.

2079
01:55:27,441 --> 01:55:28,567
My apology?

2080
01:55:30,319 --> 01:55:31,570
My apology for what?

2081
01:55:31,654 --> 01:55:33,381
For what you said
when you were sitting there

2082
01:55:33,405 --> 01:55:35,616
eating your ice cream
like some fucking king.

2083
01:55:36,951 --> 01:55:39,286
That was an ethnic slur. "You people.”

2084
01:55:40,204 --> 01:55:41,973
- Did you know what he said?
- Nah, I mean, I heard...

2085
01:55:41,997 --> 01:55:44,351
I heard you had an altercation
in the can, but I don't know.

2086
01:55:44,375 --> 01:55:46,001
Yeah, "you people.”

2087
01:55:47,461 --> 01:55:49,213
That's what you said. Right, Jim?

2088
01:55:50,798 --> 01:55:53,008
"You people." Am I beneath you?

2089
01:55:55,094 --> 01:55:56,262
Definitely.

2090
01:55:56,345 --> 01:55:58,306
- Jimmy, come on.
- Jimmy, what're you doing?

2091
01:55:58,389 --> 01:56:00,433
Don't forget, "you people"
got you where you are.

2092
01:56:00,516 --> 01:56:02,393
Don't tell me that, you fucking...

2093
01:56:02,476 --> 01:56:03,644
That's your problem, Jimmy.

2094
01:56:03,727 --> 01:56:06,856
- Your problem is you're a piece of shit.
- Jimmy, come on.

2095
01:56:06,939 --> 01:56:08,875
- Jimmy, what are you doin'?
- Jesus, Jimmy, come on.

2096
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:10,902
I asked for your endorsement
and you're giving me...

2097
01:56:10,985 --> 01:56:12,028
I asked for your apology.

2098
01:56:12,111 --> 01:56:14,488
Who the fuck are you to apologize to?

2099
01:56:14,572 --> 01:56:15,865
Jimmy...

2100
01:56:15,948 --> 01:56:17,324
Who the fuck are you?

2101
01:56:17,408 --> 01:56:18,409
Be gentle.

2102
01:56:18,492 --> 01:56:20,303
- I don't need this.
- Let's just sit down. Tony.

2103
01:56:20,327 --> 01:56:22,288
I need this? I need you?

2104
01:56:22,371 --> 01:56:23,790
- Yeah, you need me.
- Please.

2105
01:56:23,873 --> 01:56:25,392
Jimmy, come on.
You're asking him for something.

2106
01:56:25,416 --> 01:56:28,336
The guy gets me nervous.
He talks about things that get me upset.

2107
01:56:28,419 --> 01:56:29,646
Take it easy. Everybody's here.

2108
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:32,214
Let's have the fucking meeting.
Come on.

2109
01:56:32,298 --> 01:56:33,883
- Let's talk.
- That's all.

2110
01:56:33,966 --> 01:56:35,092
He's here.

2111
01:56:39,513 --> 01:56:41,599
Was this the altercation
youse had in the can?

2112
01:56:41,682 --> 01:56:44,832
Yeah, it was something like this.
We... We got to arm wrestling.

2113
01:56:45,561 --> 01:56:48,439
- He lost.
- I lost. You should see his ribs.

2114
01:56:49,607 --> 01:56:50,667
Why don't you just talk about

2115
01:56:50,691 --> 01:56:52,943
what you need to talk about.

2116
01:56:53,027 --> 01:56:54,327
What do you want me to do?

2117
01:56:55,237 --> 01:56:56,239
I said, "you people."

2118
01:56:56,322 --> 01:56:58,042
What do you want me to do,
apologize for it?

2119
01:56:58,115 --> 01:57:00,365
That's exactly what I want,
Jimmy. An apology.

2120
01:57:00,826 --> 01:57:02,703
I'll apologize for it.

2121
01:57:02,786 --> 01:57:03,913
That's all I want.

2122
01:57:05,581 --> 01:57:07,166
After you apologize

2123
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:09,043
for being late,

2124
01:57:09,793 --> 01:57:12,087
you motherfucking wop cocksucker.

2125
01:57:12,171 --> 01:57:15,507
Jimmy, are you out of your fucking mind?

2126
01:57:15,591 --> 01:57:17,384
I'll apologize for being late

2127
01:57:17,468 --> 01:57:19,846
after I kidnap your granddaughter,
rip her guts out,

2128
01:57:19,929 --> 01:57:22,029
and send them to you
in a fucking envelope!

2129
01:57:25,976 --> 01:57:27,895
Get him off! Come on!

2130
01:57:27,978 --> 01:57:30,328
- I'll fucking kill him!
- Come on, Tony! Jesus!

2131
01:57:36,070 --> 01:57:37,780
You think Russ would...

2132
01:57:37,863 --> 01:57:39,615
would do something about this guy?

2133
01:57:40,532 --> 01:57:42,201
That's complicated.

2134
01:57:43,285 --> 01:57:44,536
Yeah. It's complicated.

2135
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:46,956
I'd like to clip the motherfucker myself,
you know,

2136
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:49,333
-get the okay from them. But —
-I know.

2137
01:57:49,416 --> 01:57:50,876
This guy's gotta go.

2138
01:57:51,543 --> 01:57:53,043
- He's gotta go, Frank.
- Yeah.

2139
01:57:53,462 --> 01:57:55,362
I'm not gonna get the okay to do that.

2140
01:57:56,757 --> 01:57:58,634
Frank, just talk to the guy.

2141
01:57:58,717 --> 01:58:00,803
Okay? Just talk to him.

2142
01:58:09,561 --> 01:58:10,646
These guys from Jersey keep

2143
01:58:10,729 --> 01:58:13,166
fucking calling me about this bullshit
between these two guys.

2144
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:15,609
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told them.

2145
01:58:16,277 --> 01:58:17,278
I don't approve

2146
01:58:17,361 --> 01:58:18,946
- of what Pro said about Jimmy.
- No.

2147
01:58:19,029 --> 01:58:21,949
I mean, who talks like that
about a person's grandchildren?

2148
01:58:22,491 --> 01:58:24,285
- It's not fucking right.
- No.

2149
01:58:29,623 --> 01:58:30,833
But Pro isn't nobody.

2150
01:58:32,042 --> 01:58:33,335
Jimmy should know that.

2151
01:58:33,419 --> 01:58:34,670
Hey, what am I gonna go?

2152
01:58:34,753 --> 01:58:37,506
I'm not gonna tell this guy
what he can or can't fucking say,

2153
01:58:37,589 --> 01:58:38,841
like he's a child.

2154
01:58:38,924 --> 01:58:40,217
Well, listen.

2155
01:58:40,301 --> 01:58:42,220
Jimmy don't mean nothing.
He just gets upset.

2156
01:58:42,303 --> 01:58:44,197
Russ, come on,
we all know he's a fucking hothead.

2157
01:58:44,221 --> 01:58:45,615
We're all hotheads once in a while.

2158
01:58:45,639 --> 01:58:47,892
Yeah, but Jimmy says things
he shouldn't say sometimes.

2159
01:58:47,975 --> 01:58:49,518
Yeah. We all do that too.

2160
01:58:49,601 --> 01:58:51,651
Well, somebody should just calm him down.

2161
01:58:56,233 --> 01:58:57,860
Yeah, well, that... I'm gonna...

2162
01:58:57,943 --> 01:58:59,946
I'm gonna calm him down.
He's difficult, but...

2163
01:59:00,029 --> 01:59:01,947
Maybe this could help him calm down.

2164
01:59:02,031 --> 01:59:04,131
You could tell him
that I always liked him.

2165
01:59:05,909 --> 01:59:08,913
And I won't stand in his way
of him trying to get his job back.

2166
01:59:08,996 --> 01:59:10,140
I will. I will tell him that, Tony.

2167
01:59:10,164 --> 01:59:11,165
- Okay?
- Yes.

2168
01:59:11,248 --> 01:59:13,834
That's not making me calm down.

2169
01:59:13,917 --> 01:59:15,169
Standing by me.

2170
01:59:15,711 --> 01:59:17,796
What the fuck does that mean?

2171
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:21,300
Standing by me ain't the same thing
as doing something

2172
01:59:21,383 --> 01:59:24,887
about some out-of-control fucking psycho!

2173
01:59:25,512 --> 01:59:28,391
Jimmy, the Little Guy ain't a nobody.
You gotta understand that.

2174
01:59:28,474 --> 01:59:30,142
- He ain't a nobody.
- He's a cocksucker.

2175
01:59:30,225 --> 01:59:31,935
Fitz is a cocksucker.

2176
01:59:32,811 --> 01:59:35,272
I'm gonna deal
with both these cocksuckers...

2177
01:59:35,356 --> 01:59:36,482
myself!

2178
01:59:37,316 --> 01:59:39,401
This used to be my office.

2179
01:59:39,485 --> 01:59:42,571
Go look for Frank Fitzsimmons there.
You're not gonna find him.

2180
01:59:42,654 --> 01:59:45,657
That's because he travels
all over the country

2181
01:59:45,741 --> 01:59:48,952
looking for goddamn golf courses
because that's what he does.

2182
01:59:49,036 --> 01:59:50,079
He plays golf.

2183
01:59:50,162 --> 01:59:53,999
Who is he to run around with Nixon,
run around with the attorney general?

2184
01:59:54,083 --> 01:59:58,170
He does this and collects full-time salary
while he's doing it.

2185
01:59:58,253 --> 01:59:59,505
Now, how do you do that?

2186
01:59:59,588 --> 02:00:02,591
There's not enough hours
in a day to do this job.

2187
02:00:02,674 --> 02:00:04,843
I was sent to prison for fraud.

2188
02:00:05,552 --> 02:00:07,262
This is fraud, what he's doing.

2189
02:00:09,223 --> 02:00:11,517
<i>(Frank) So what's Fitz's answer to Jimmy?</i>

2190
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:12,935
He does it by sending a message

2191
02:00:13,018 --> 02:00:15,729
to Jimmy's old friend, Dave Johnson.

2192
02:00:15,813 --> 02:00:19,066
Now, Dave Johnson, he ran Local 299.

2193
02:00:20,734 --> 02:00:22,277
This was the message.

2194
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:30,577
So this is how Fitz says
he wants my old pal Dave Johnson

2195
02:00:30,661 --> 02:00:33,288
to step down so he can have his son

2196
02:00:33,372 --> 02:00:35,874
take over Local 299.

2197
02:00:36,375 --> 02:00:40,587
This is how I'm gonna say no to his son,
little fucking Fitz.

2198
02:00:42,047 --> 02:00:43,274
She looked a lot like your mother.

2199
02:00:43,298 --> 02:00:45,193
- About the same size.
- Pops, come on, you told me...

2200
02:00:45,217 --> 02:00:47,553
Good-looking girl.
She was a good-looking girl.

2201
02:00:47,636 --> 02:00:49,930
But I had no idea
that it wasn't your mother.

2202
02:00:50,013 --> 02:00:51,014
It was dark and...

2203
02:01:00,190 --> 02:01:02,734
This is how Fitz says he doesn't like

2204
02:01:02,818 --> 02:01:05,070
who I say runs the 299.

2205
02:01:05,779 --> 02:01:07,322
By firing my wife from her

2206
02:01:07,406 --> 02:01:11,243
48-fucking-thousand-
dollar-a-year union job!

2207
02:01:54,495 --> 02:01:56,872
Son of a bitch. Fuck him!

2208
02:01:56,955 --> 02:01:58,916
He had previously taped the locks

2209
02:01:58,999 --> 02:02:01,710
on the entry door
of the basement of the Watergate...

2210
02:02:01,793 --> 02:02:03,543
- What are you looking at?
- It's...

2211
02:02:04,421 --> 02:02:05,506
It's Big Ears.

2212
02:02:06,048 --> 02:02:08,800
He had noticed
that the tape had been removed...

2213
02:02:09,843 --> 02:02:12,179
and he re-taped the door.

2214
02:02:12,804 --> 02:02:14,389
Big Ears?

2215
02:02:14,473 --> 02:02:15,641
That's...

2216
02:02:15,724 --> 02:02:17,674
Somebody I met a long time ago. Just...

2217
02:02:19,937 --> 02:02:21,146
His ears ain't so big.

2218
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:24,233
At that point, I said "Let us junk it,"

2219
02:02:24,316 --> 02:02:25,901
meaning let us scrap the operation.

2220
02:02:25,984 --> 02:02:30,113
Mr. Liddy and Mr. McCord
talked between themselves

2221
02:02:30,197 --> 02:02:32,950
and the decision was made to go.

2222
02:02:33,033 --> 02:02:34,353
I thought it was very foolhardy...

2223
02:02:34,409 --> 02:02:36,287
So, Frank Fitzsimmons, in your opinion,

2224
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:38,789
should he remain
president of the Teamsters?

2225
02:02:38,872 --> 02:02:40,040
Absolutely not.

2226
02:02:40,123 --> 02:02:42,876
Frank Fitzsimmons has sold his union out

2227
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,503
to his underworld pals.

2228
02:02:44,586 --> 02:02:46,213
The Mob controls him,

2229
02:02:46,797 --> 02:02:48,841
which means it controls our pension fund.

2230
02:02:48,924 --> 02:02:53,011
I'm talking about a billion dollars
in low or no-interest loans

2231
02:02:53,095 --> 02:02:57,432
<i>this man has given to known racketeers
for their illegal enterprises.</i>

2232
02:02:57,516 --> 02:02:58,725
Not anymore.

2233
02:02:58,809 --> 02:03:01,645
It's time for the rats to abandon ship.

2234
02:03:02,187 --> 02:03:03,230
Is he serious?

2235
02:03:03,730 --> 02:03:05,816
Not Jimmy. This is all publicity.

2236
02:03:05,899 --> 02:03:07,860
He's running for office.
He's putting on a show.

2237
02:03:07,943 --> 02:03:10,696
Yeah, it's all puff.
It's got no substance, nothing.

2238
02:03:10,779 --> 02:03:12,698
Maybe he means what he says.

2239
02:03:12,781 --> 02:03:15,367
- Tony, he's campaigning.
- Russ.

2240
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:17,286
He's liable to say any fucking thing.

2241
02:03:17,369 --> 02:03:19,079
I don't care if he's campaigning.

2242
02:03:19,162 --> 02:03:20,414
He can't talk like that.

2243
02:03:20,497 --> 02:03:21,665
It's no fucking good.

2244
02:03:21,748 --> 02:03:24,793
- I understand what you're saying.
- You know what he should do, Russ?

2245
02:03:24,876 --> 02:03:27,004
He should cash in that big pension of his.

2246
02:03:27,087 --> 02:03:29,715
Spend more time with his grandchildren.

2247
02:03:29,798 --> 02:03:31,717
He got a beautiful family, no?

2248
02:03:32,759 --> 02:03:33,802
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.

2249
02:03:33,885 --> 02:03:35,220
Maybe he should relax.

2250
02:03:37,389 --> 02:03:39,224
Word should get back to him.

2251
02:03:43,770 --> 02:03:45,147
/.. I just wanna say...

2252
02:03:45,230 --> 02:03:47,524
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

2253
02:03:48,066 --> 02:03:49,401
But there I was with some people

2254
02:03:49,484 --> 02:03:51,379
and they were saying,
and you know who they are...

2255
02:03:51,403 --> 02:03:52,529
They were saying...

2256
02:03:53,947 --> 02:03:56,491
"Please tell Jimmy we love the guy.

2257
02:03:57,326 --> 02:03:59,536
We don't want any problem.

2258
02:03:59,620 --> 02:04:01,288
We just think that he should...

2259
02:04:02,331 --> 02:04:04,124
maybe enjoy his grandchildren,

2260
02:04:04,207 --> 02:04:06,668
enjoy his pension, enjoy his life as is."

2261
02:04:06,752 --> 02:04:08,337
Go no further, Frank.

2262
02:04:10,255 --> 02:04:11,548
Who said it?

2263
02:04:12,591 --> 02:04:15,427
- It don't matter who said it.
- It matters.

2264
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:17,262
- Was it Russell? No.
- No.

2265
02:04:17,346 --> 02:04:20,057
Of course it's not Russell.
It's that little cocksucker

2266
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:22,100
from the Miami fiasco?

2267
02:04:22,184 --> 02:04:23,310
- No?
- No.

2268
02:04:23,393 --> 02:04:25,145
Not him. No?

2269
02:04:25,228 --> 02:04:26,688
Then who?

2270
02:04:28,815 --> 02:04:30,233
I'm gonna tell you.

2271
02:04:30,317 --> 02:04:31,443
Tony.

2272
02:04:31,526 --> 02:04:33,111
Tony?

2273
02:04:33,195 --> 02:04:34,488
Which Tony?

2274
02:04:34,571 --> 02:04:36,573
They're all named Tony.

2275
02:04:36,657 --> 02:04:38,617
I mean, what's the matter with Italians?

2276
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:41,161
They can only think of one name.

2277
02:04:41,244 --> 02:04:43,538
The other Tony.

2278
02:04:45,082 --> 02:04:46,124
What Tony?

2279
02:04:49,086 --> 02:04:50,170
Salerno.

2280
02:04:58,887 --> 02:05:00,430
Well, what can I say?

2281
02:05:02,474 --> 02:05:03,674
Jimmy, I'm trying to help you.

2282
02:05:03,725 --> 02:05:06,103
- I'm trying to tell you something.
- I know you are.

2283
02:05:06,186 --> 02:05:08,730
Frank, don't even think about it.

2284
02:05:09,356 --> 02:05:10,857
I don't keep my mouth shut...

2285
02:05:10,941 --> 02:05:12,276
- I know that.
- For anyone.

2286
02:05:12,359 --> 02:05:15,862
I know that, you know that,
they don't know that.

2287
02:05:17,614 --> 02:05:21,076
That's who I am, that's what I am
and that's what I'm gonna do.

2288
02:05:22,828 --> 02:05:24,329
Somebody can tell him that.

2289
02:05:24,413 --> 02:05:25,706
He said that?

2290
02:05:26,498 --> 02:05:27,708
In so many words, you know.

2291
02:05:27,791 --> 02:05:29,835
Well, before he says something like that,

2292
02:05:29,918 --> 02:05:31,604
he should remember
that Joe Gallo liked to make

2293
02:05:31,628 --> 02:05:33,338
a lot of fucking noise, too.

2294
02:05:33,422 --> 02:05:34,965
Somebody should tell him that.

2295
02:05:35,048 --> 02:05:36,341
Who said?

2296
02:05:37,884 --> 02:05:39,261
- Tony.
- He said that?

2297
02:05:39,344 --> 02:05:41,722
That's it. That does it.

2298
02:05:43,181 --> 02:05:44,891
I'm never gonna retire now.

2299
02:05:46,143 --> 02:05:47,519
Somebody can tell him that.

2300
02:05:47,602 --> 02:05:49,288
Jimmy, I did tell him.
I told him over and over.

2301
02:05:49,312 --> 02:05:51,940
All right, you told him.
Let's stop this, then. Forget it.

2302
02:05:52,023 --> 02:05:53,233
Enough.

2303
02:05:53,984 --> 02:05:55,777
Let me enjoy my ice cream here.

2304
02:06:01,408 --> 02:06:02,951
What's the matter?

2305
02:06:03,034 --> 02:06:05,245
- Nothing.
- What?

2306
02:06:05,328 --> 02:06:06,639
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

2307
02:06:06,663 --> 02:06:08,713
Come on, you're thinking something. What?

2308
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:10,625
I just...

2309
02:06:11,835 --> 02:06:13,545
What? Come on. What are you doing?

2310
02:06:13,628 --> 02:06:14,713
It ain't the right time.

2311
02:06:14,796 --> 02:06:16,566
What do you mean it ain't the right time?
It is the right time.

2312
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:18,633
What isn't the right time?
Say it.

2313
02:06:20,677 --> 02:06:22,637
The Local's putting together

2314
02:06:22,721 --> 02:06:25,265
a testimonial dinner for me and...

2315
02:06:25,348 --> 02:06:27,267
A testimonial dinner for you, that's good.

2316
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:29,394
Yeah. But later... Later, when...

2317
02:06:29,978 --> 02:06:31,313
What's the matter?

2318
02:06:35,317 --> 02:06:37,903
I was gonna ask you if you would...

2319
02:06:37,986 --> 02:06:39,613
present the award to me.

2320
02:06:40,906 --> 02:06:42,032
Well...

2321
02:06:42,866 --> 02:06:44,409
That's nice of you, Frank.

2322
02:06:44,493 --> 02:06:46,828
Really. That's nice of you.
And, you know...

2323
02:06:47,412 --> 02:06:48,455
Who's gonna be there?

2324
02:06:48,538 --> 02:06:51,166
- Everybody.
- Tony.

2325
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,337
Tony, Tony, Tony, and Tony?

2326
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:58,340
Everybody from Downtown.

2327
02:06:59,424 --> 02:07:01,885
Nah. Nah, it ain't a good idea.
Everybody's gonna be there.

2328
02:07:01,968 --> 02:07:04,679
People... You're gonna be uncomfortable.

2329
02:07:04,763 --> 02:07:07,849
I don't give a fuck who's there.

2330
02:07:07,933 --> 02:07:09,351
We gonna let those cocksuckers

2331
02:07:09,434 --> 02:07:12,437
keep me from your big night?
There's no way.

2332
02:07:12,521 --> 02:07:13,647
No.

2333
02:07:13,730 --> 02:07:17,484
I'm gonna be there.
And I'll be honored to be there.

2334
02:07:17,567 --> 02:07:18,777
You deserve this.

2335
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:20,710
- Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you.
- Yeah.

2336
02:07:23,949 --> 02:07:26,409
- Ooh, that Mo Dean.
- Yeah.

2337
02:07:27,202 --> 02:07:28,912
- She's a good-looking broad.
- She's nice.

2338
02:07:28,995 --> 02:07:30,413
I did not realize

2339
02:07:30,497 --> 02:07:32,458
that Mr. Howard Hunt
worked most of the time

2340
02:07:32,541 --> 02:07:35,586
while he was at the White House
in the plumbers unit until after June...

2341
02:07:35,669 --> 02:07:37,838
He's a rat, but that's, you know...

2342
02:07:37,921 --> 02:07:39,571
He's a rat. But he's a smart rat.

2343
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:44,302
We've got a great crowd

2344
02:07:44,386 --> 02:07:46,304
for Frank tonight?
Come on. Give it up.

2345
02:07:49,724 --> 02:07:53,812
That's because Frank is a man
with a lot of friends.

2346
02:07:55,981 --> 02:07:58,859
From his war buddies
who fought with him in Italy

2347
02:07:58,942 --> 02:08:01,278
under General George Patton...

2348
02:08:02,779 --> 02:08:05,949
to the drivers, national organizers,

2349
02:08:06,032 --> 02:08:08,827
business agents, local presidents,

2350
02:08:08,910 --> 02:08:12,497
joint committee chairmen,
and regional trustees,

2351
02:08:12,581 --> 02:08:14,791
we are all friends

2352
02:08:14,875 --> 02:08:16,668
of Frank's tonight.

2353
02:08:16,751 --> 02:08:18,211
Friends of Frank.

2354
02:08:20,130 --> 02:08:22,966
Like NAACP president Cecil Moore.

2355
02:08:24,509 --> 02:08:26,678
District Attorney Emmett Fitzpatrick.

2356
02:08:28,138 --> 02:08:30,307
Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo.

2357
02:08:31,933 --> 02:08:33,768
Hey, they like you, Frank.

2358
02:08:34,519 --> 02:08:36,688
And, of course, our featured speaker,

2359
02:08:36,771 --> 02:08:38,481
James Riddle Hoffa.

2360
02:08:46,156 --> 02:08:48,325
And meanwhile, outside in the trees,

2361
02:08:48,408 --> 02:08:50,035
we got the FBI.

2362
02:08:51,244 --> 02:08:52,787
Somebody wanna check on them?

2363
02:08:54,956 --> 02:08:56,893
Now, let me tell you
about the first time I met Frank.

2364
02:08:56,917 --> 02:08:58,668
He took me out to a steak dinner,

2365
02:08:58,752 --> 02:09:01,213
and he asked me, he said,
"How do you like your steak?"

2366
02:09:01,296 --> 02:09:03,173
I said, "I like it rare.”
He said, "Me too.”

2367
02:09:03,256 --> 02:09:05,342
Well, they bring out the steaks.
Mine's rare.

2368
02:09:05,425 --> 02:09:07,525
Frank's was still walking
from the kitchen.

2369
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:11,223
He turns to me, he said, "Well, you know,

2370
02:09:11,306 --> 02:09:13,456
I'm an animal lover.
I don't wanna hurt it."

2371
02:09:15,644 --> 02:09:16,694
He's an animal lover.

2372
02:09:41,211 --> 02:09:45,061
This guy is not even the goddamn president
and he's holding up people's loans.

2373
02:09:45,924 --> 02:09:47,676
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

2374
02:09:48,176 --> 02:09:49,445
And how's he supposed to do that?

2375
02:09:49,469 --> 02:09:50,655
Because his guys
are holding 'em back loans

2376
02:09:50,679 --> 02:09:52,931
on Carlos's new hotel in New Orleans,

2377
02:09:53,014 --> 02:09:54,975
the add-on that we're doing at Caesars.

2378
02:09:59,562 --> 02:10:01,940
- And what's Fitz doing all this time?
- Fitz?

2379
02:10:02,023 --> 02:10:03,775
Yeah, he's supposed to help
with this shit.

2380
02:10:03,858 --> 02:10:05,861
The money comes
from the Pension Fund trustees.

2381
02:10:05,944 --> 02:10:07,529
They gotta sign off on it.

2382
02:10:07,612 --> 02:10:09,732
They're supposed to be rubber-stamping
what Fitz says.

2383
02:10:09,781 --> 02:10:12,075
- Right, right. Yeah.
- Except Jimmy

2384
02:10:12,158 --> 02:10:14,411
has a couple of them
to stop rubber-stamping.

2385
02:10:16,496 --> 02:10:18,373
The son of a bitch.

2386
02:10:18,456 --> 02:10:20,006
I thought we took care of that.

2387
02:10:21,418 --> 02:10:22,669
You know what he told somebody?

2388
02:10:22,752 --> 02:10:24,796
He goes, once Fitz is out and he's in,

2389
02:10:24,879 --> 02:10:26,965
he's gonna call in the old loans.

2390
02:10:27,048 --> 02:10:30,719
Hotels, casinos, real estate,
no matter what it is.

2391
02:10:30,802 --> 02:10:33,030
And if you don't have his money
and interest in two seconds,

2392
02:10:33,054 --> 02:10:34,264
he's taking 'em over.

2393
02:10:34,889 --> 02:10:35,890
We can't have that.

2394
02:10:38,643 --> 02:10:40,562
- He said that?
- He said that.

2395
02:10:40,645 --> 02:10:42,063
You sure he said that, Tony?

2396
02:10:42,147 --> 02:10:43,648
He said that.

2397
02:10:43,732 --> 02:10:45,651
Everything I'm telling you, yeah, he said.

2398
02:10:45,734 --> 02:10:47,819
I mean, who does he think he is? Castro?

2399
02:11:14,929 --> 02:11:16,014
It's not about money.

2400
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:17,849
If it's not about money,

2401
02:11:17,932 --> 02:11:19,726
then I'm really having
trouble understanding,

2402
02:11:19,809 --> 02:11:22,159
because I don't know
what all the talk is about.

2403
02:11:22,479 --> 02:11:23,646
It's my union.

2404
02:11:24,898 --> 02:11:26,525
- Is that hard to understand?
- No, no.

2405
02:11:26,608 --> 02:11:29,319
It's your union, that's right.
It'll always be your union.

2406
02:11:29,402 --> 02:11:31,196
You could step down and still run it.

2407
02:11:31,279 --> 02:11:33,198
No, you don't step down.
What do you mean?

2408
02:11:33,281 --> 02:11:35,366
Russ, you don't step down to run a union.

2409
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:37,150
You step down to go to your grave.

2410
02:11:37,327 --> 02:11:38,912
Well, listen.

2411
02:11:39,412 --> 02:11:42,040
I still think...
I can't help but think, I'm sorry,

2412
02:11:42,123 --> 02:11:44,209
but is there another reason or something?

2413
02:11:44,292 --> 02:11:47,087
This is my union!
What do you mean, "another reason"?

2414
02:11:48,546 --> 02:11:50,090
This is my union.

2415
02:11:50,173 --> 02:11:53,760
All right? Let's start with that
and then try to understand things.

2416
02:11:53,843 --> 02:11:55,762
Listen, some people,

2417
02:11:56,429 --> 02:11:59,265
not me, but some people,

2418
02:11:59,891 --> 02:12:01,392
they're a little concerned.

2419
02:12:02,185 --> 02:12:04,646
Some people, not me,
they think that you might...

2420
02:12:05,605 --> 02:12:06,689
I might...

2421
02:12:06,773 --> 02:12:10,819
You might be demonstrating
a failure to show appreciation.

2422
02:12:13,571 --> 02:12:15,021
I'm not showing appreciation?

2423
02:12:15,990 --> 02:12:17,909
According to, you know, some people.

2424
02:12:17,992 --> 02:12:20,870
I went to school for five fucking years.

2425
02:12:20,954 --> 02:12:23,456
- Yes, you did.
- Five fucking years.

2426
02:12:24,999 --> 02:12:27,001
I didn't name one fucking name.

2427
02:12:27,085 --> 02:12:28,562
- You did the right thing.
- I did the right thing.

2428
02:12:28,586 --> 02:12:29,588
You did the right thing.

2429
02:12:29,671 --> 02:12:31,464
I sat there every day with that

2430
02:12:31,548 --> 02:12:35,718
whining cocksucker from New Jersey,
talking to me

2431
02:12:35,802 --> 02:12:38,388
about his woes, his problems,

2432
02:12:39,305 --> 02:12:42,055
and all I wanted to do
was finish my ice cream in peace.

2433
02:12:43,601 --> 02:12:44,602
This cocksucker

2434
02:12:44,686 --> 02:12:48,106
shows up at a meeting 15 minutes late,

2435
02:12:48,898 --> 02:12:50,608
wearing fucking shorts!

2436
02:12:51,609 --> 02:12:54,070
- Who wears shorts to a meeting?
- Nobody.

2437
02:12:54,154 --> 02:12:55,613
- That's right.
- Nobody.

2438
02:12:56,531 --> 02:12:58,241
I'm not showing appreciation?

2439
02:12:58,324 --> 02:12:59,325
It's not me.

2440
02:12:59,868 --> 02:13:00,908
According to some people...

2441
02:13:00,952 --> 02:13:03,163
No, I know it's not you. Some people...

2442
02:13:03,705 --> 02:13:06,082
Some people say
I'm not showing appreciation?

2443
02:13:06,166 --> 02:13:07,458
Well, then fuck them.

2444
02:13:08,501 --> 02:13:09,795
I'm trying to help you, Jim.

2445
02:13:09,878 --> 02:13:10,879
I know you are.

2446
02:13:11,588 --> 02:13:13,548
But nobody threatens Hoffa.

2447
02:13:13,631 --> 02:13:15,675
<i>3 The time is now &</i>

2448
02:13:15,758 --> 02:13:18,052
I Right now I

2449
02:13:18,136 --> 02:13:22,515
& The time is now &

2450
02:13:35,403 --> 02:13:37,739
He has done it as a driver,

2451
02:13:37,822 --> 02:13:40,158
he has done it as an organizer,

2452
02:13:40,241 --> 02:13:42,994
and I don't think
many of you here know this,

2453
02:13:43,077 --> 02:13:45,622
but Frank holds a record.

2454
02:13:46,497 --> 02:13:50,210
It's most arrests on the picket line.

2455
02:13:51,544 --> 02:13:54,339
Twenty-six times

2456
02:13:54,422 --> 02:13:57,675
in 24 hours, beating my record.

2457
02:14:00,094 --> 02:14:03,556
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
There's no exaggeration.

2458
02:14:05,141 --> 02:14:06,851
He is a union man

2459
02:14:06,935 --> 02:14:09,729
to his bones.

2460
02:14:09,812 --> 02:14:11,356
Which side are you on?

2461
02:14:11,439 --> 02:14:12,899
Your side!

2462
02:14:12,982 --> 02:14:13,983
Whose side?

2463
02:14:14,067 --> 02:14:15,068
Your side!

2464
02:14:15,151 --> 02:14:17,195
- My side.
- Your side.

2465
02:14:17,278 --> 02:14:18,947
- His side.
- Yeah!

2466
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:20,281
There it is.

2467
02:14:21,032 --> 02:14:24,619
And so, it is an honor for me
to be here tonight

2468
02:14:24,702 --> 02:14:26,496
to present this award

2469
02:14:26,579 --> 02:14:28,748
to my dear friend,

2470
02:14:28,831 --> 02:14:31,000
Mr. Frank Sheeran!

2471
02:14:40,551 --> 02:14:42,804
Thank you, Jimmy, thank you so much.

2472
02:14:43,846 --> 02:14:46,224
And thank you to my lovely wife Reenie

2473
02:14:46,307 --> 02:14:48,685
for being here with me.

2474
02:14:48,768 --> 02:14:51,437
My lovely, sweet, adorable daughters,

2475
02:14:51,521 --> 02:14:52,939
Maryanne,

2476
02:14:53,022 --> 02:14:54,649
Dolores, Connie,

2477
02:14:54,732 --> 02:14:57,026
Peggy, for putting up with me

2478
02:14:57,110 --> 02:14:59,779
for all these years.

2479
02:14:59,862 --> 02:15:02,907
And, Jimmy, I can't tell you
what this means to me

2480
02:15:02,991 --> 02:15:04,341
to get this honor from you.

2481
02:15:05,076 --> 02:15:08,329
It's the highlight of my life.
Thank you very, very much.

2482
02:15:08,413 --> 02:15:11,666
And this man, James Riddle Hoffa,

2483
02:15:12,417 --> 02:15:14,669
is the guy that gets the job done.

2484
02:15:17,130 --> 02:15:18,881
I'm behind you, Jimmy.

2485
02:15:18,965 --> 02:15:20,008
All the way.

2486
02:15:21,926 --> 02:15:23,136
In any case,

2487
02:15:23,219 --> 02:15:25,597
from the deepest part of my heart,
I thank you all.

2488
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:27,630
"Cause I don't really deserve all this.

2489
02:15:28,599 --> 02:15:31,269
But I have bursitis
and I don't deserve that either.

2490
02:15:33,062 --> 02:15:35,357
Thank you all tonight
and thank you for coming.

2491
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:36,441
Good night.

2492
02:15:47,785 --> 02:15:49,579
What happened to "Say cheese"?

2493
02:15:50,079 --> 02:15:51,080
Cheese!

2494
02:17:06,948 --> 02:17:09,659
Only three people
in the world have one of these.

2495
02:17:09,742 --> 02:17:12,120
And only one of them is Irish.

2496
02:17:12,203 --> 02:17:13,621
I have one.

2497
02:17:13,704 --> 02:17:15,039
Angelo has one.

2498
02:17:17,583 --> 02:17:18,709
Now you have one.

2499
02:17:23,589 --> 02:17:24,757
This is beautiful.

2500
02:17:28,845 --> 02:17:31,545
I... I don't...
I don't know what to say, Russ. It's...

2501
02:17:32,765 --> 02:17:34,392
Slip it on. See how it looks.

2502
02:17:38,771 --> 02:17:40,189
- Feel good?
- Yeah.

2503
02:17:42,275 --> 02:17:45,236
You know how strong I made you?
You know how strong?

2504
02:17:46,988 --> 02:17:48,114
You're my kid.

2505
02:17:49,282 --> 02:17:51,701
Nobody... Nobody can fuck with you.

2506
02:17:51,784 --> 02:17:52,869
Nobody.

2507
02:17:56,789 --> 02:17:58,791
([singer singing "Al Di La")

2508
02:18:18,644 --> 02:18:20,188
Listen, Frank.

2509
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:24,066
Things have gotten out of hand
with our friend again.

2510
02:18:25,234 --> 02:18:28,529
And some people are having
serious problems with him.

2511
02:18:29,405 --> 02:18:32,033
And, it's at a point where

2512
02:18:32,116 --> 02:18:34,660
you're gonna have to talk to him
and tell him...

2513
02:18:35,661 --> 02:18:37,163
it's what it is.

2514
02:18:39,874 --> 02:18:40,958
What it is?

2515
02:18:41,042 --> 02:18:43,044
Yes. It's what they want.

2516
02:18:43,628 --> 02:18:44,879
It's where it's gotten.

2517
02:18:46,464 --> 02:18:49,217
You're close to him.
Maybe he'll listen to you.

2518
02:18:49,300 --> 02:18:50,718
You know I talked to him.

2519
02:18:50,801 --> 02:18:52,804
He's a tough guy to talk to.
You know him.

2520
02:18:52,887 --> 02:18:54,472
He has no choice.

2521
02:18:54,555 --> 02:18:56,098
He has no choice.

2522
02:18:56,891 --> 02:18:58,226
These are the higher-ups.

2523
02:19:00,228 --> 02:19:02,396
Well, he's a higher-up too.
I mean... No?

2524
02:19:03,523 --> 02:19:05,233
Not like this. You know that.

2525
02:19:05,316 --> 02:19:07,026
Come on now, Frank.

2526
02:19:10,238 --> 02:19:12,281
If they can whack a president,

2527
02:19:12,365 --> 02:19:14,365
they can whack a president of the union.

2528
02:19:16,202 --> 02:19:18,704
You know it and I know it.

2529
02:19:29,090 --> 02:19:30,943
I talk to this guy,
I talk to him, I talk to him,

2530
02:19:30,967 --> 02:19:32,427
I talk to him, he don't listen.

2531
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:35,010
But he's gotta listen now.
I gotta make him listen.

2532
02:19:37,306 --> 02:19:40,393
That ain't right. He's...
He's a fucking knucklehead.

2533
02:19:51,487 --> 02:19:52,488
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

2534
02:19:52,572 --> 02:19:54,198
I talked to Russ.

2535
02:19:54,282 --> 02:19:55,491
He talked to Tony.

2536
02:19:55,575 --> 02:19:56,875
He means what he's saying.

2537
02:19:57,785 --> 02:19:59,745
- Who? Russ?
- No, Tony.

2538
02:19:59,829 --> 02:20:00,955
- Tony?
- Yeah.

2539
02:20:01,831 --> 02:20:03,291
Well, I mean what I'm saying.

2540
02:20:04,208 --> 02:20:07,920
He can't seem to get that
through his fat, fucking Sicilian head.

2541
02:20:08,004 --> 02:20:09,755
Can he? Don't worry about it.

2542
02:20:09,839 --> 02:20:11,090
What's the matter with you?

2543
02:20:11,173 --> 02:20:12,592
You... You look...

2544
02:20:12,675 --> 02:20:13,835
- I'm concerned.
- Yeah, I know.

2545
02:20:13,884 --> 02:20:15,804
You look concerned.
What are you concerned about?

2546
02:20:15,845 --> 02:20:18,264
- 'M... I'm...
- They should be concerned.

2547
02:20:18,347 --> 02:20:19,825
- They are. They are.
- Well, let them be.

2548
02:20:19,849 --> 02:20:22,936
They're more than a little concerned.
There's widespread concern.

2549
02:20:23,019 --> 02:20:24,270
It's a big problem.

2550
02:20:25,771 --> 02:20:29,358
Tony told the old man
to tell me to tell you...

2551
02:20:29,442 --> 02:20:31,277
"It's what it is.”

2552
02:20:35,573 --> 02:20:37,617
- What it is?
- It's what it is.

2553
02:20:41,621 --> 02:20:42,872
Please, listen to me.

2554
02:20:45,124 --> 02:20:46,959
They wouldn't dare.

2555
02:20:47,043 --> 02:20:48,794
- Don't...
- They wouldn't dare.

2556
02:20:48,878 --> 02:20:50,713
- Jimmy...
- Please, Frank, come on.

2557
02:20:50,796 --> 02:20:52,465
- Don't say they wouldn't dare.
- No.

2558
02:20:52,548 --> 02:20:55,676
Don't... Don't tell me that kinda...
That's fairy tales.

2559
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:57,428
No, don't say they wouldn't dare.

2560
02:20:58,012 --> 02:21:00,640
If something funny happens to me...

2561
02:21:02,683 --> 02:21:03,684
they're done.

2562
02:21:03,768 --> 02:21:05,645
You understand that? And they know it.

2563
02:21:05,728 --> 02:21:08,314
Because I got files. I got proof.

2564
02:21:08,397 --> 02:21:09,440
I got records.

2565
02:21:09,523 --> 02:21:12,652
I got tapes.
Anytime I want, they'll be gone.

2566
02:21:12,735 --> 02:21:14,028
These Guinea motherfuckers

2567
02:21:14,111 --> 02:21:16,405
will spend
the rest of their lives in jail,

2568
02:21:16,489 --> 02:21:18,074
and they know it.

2569
02:21:18,866 --> 02:21:20,242
They know it.

2570
02:21:20,326 --> 02:21:21,970
But what you're saying
is what they're concerned about.

2571
02:21:21,994 --> 02:21:23,580
What I'm saying is I know things.

2572
02:21:23,663 --> 02:21:26,666
I know things they don't know I know.

2573
02:21:27,458 --> 02:21:29,627
-Please —
-Are you gonna take that chance?

2574
02:21:29,710 --> 02:21:31,605
What chance am I...
Why should I be taking a chance?

2575
02:21:31,629 --> 02:21:33,047
They're saying this is it.

2576
02:21:34,006 --> 02:21:35,651
They're saying this is it,
and then it's it?

2577
02:21:35,675 --> 02:21:38,094
Bullshit. Bullshit, Frank. Come on.

2578
02:21:38,177 --> 02:21:39,655
Jimmy, I'm trying to tell you something.

2579
02:21:39,679 --> 02:21:41,948
I know you are. You're telling me
that they're threatening me

2580
02:21:41,972 --> 02:21:43,391
and I gotta do what they say.

2581
02:21:43,474 --> 02:21:46,394
It's more than a threat.
It's the bottom line.

2582
02:21:46,477 --> 02:21:47,478
The bottom line.

2583
02:21:48,312 --> 02:21:49,480
It's what it is.

2584
02:21:49,563 --> 02:21:52,066
They do something to me,
I do something to them.

2585
02:21:53,234 --> 02:21:55,884
That's all I know.
I don't know anything else. Do you?

2586
02:21:58,155 --> 02:22:00,605
So what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna tell McGee?

2587
02:22:01,158 --> 02:22:02,660
That you're not gonna listen?

2588
02:22:02,743 --> 02:22:03,970
He ain't used to people
not listening to him.

2589
02:22:03,994 --> 02:22:04,995
Well, neither am I.

2590
02:22:06,664 --> 02:22:08,541
- What?
- Neither am I.

2591
02:22:08,624 --> 02:22:10,292
Then I don't know what to do.

2592
02:22:10,376 --> 02:22:12,145
I mean, maybe you should
get some bodies around you

2593
02:22:12,169 --> 02:22:14,088
- for protection.
- Come on. Please.

2594
02:22:14,171 --> 02:22:15,756
I'm not gonna go that route.

2595
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:17,383
Don't do this to me, Frank.

2596
02:22:17,466 --> 02:22:19,927
What do you mean, "bodies around me"?
I don't need...

2597
02:22:20,010 --> 02:22:22,388
You put bodies around you,
then they go after your family.

2598
02:22:22,471 --> 02:22:24,724
- It doesn't matter. You worried?
- I'm worried.

2599
02:22:24,807 --> 02:22:27,057
Get some bodies around you.
I'll tell you why.

2600
02:22:28,310 --> 02:22:29,645
This could happen to you.

2601
02:22:29,729 --> 02:22:31,397
They could come after you

2602
02:22:31,981 --> 02:22:33,774
since you're with me.

2603
02:22:33,858 --> 02:22:35,151
No?

2604
02:22:37,361 --> 02:22:38,946
I'm worried.

2605
02:22:39,029 --> 02:22:41,179
Tell Russ I got nothing
but respect for him.

2606
02:22:41,490 --> 02:22:43,951
I got a little trouble with him.

2607
02:22:44,034 --> 02:22:46,204
We were talking before
and I just got a little crazy.

2608
02:22:46,287 --> 02:22:48,164
You know how I am. I just blow.

2609
02:22:48,247 --> 02:22:49,373
- Sometimes.
- Yeah.

2610
02:22:49,457 --> 02:22:50,792
I just walked away like that.

2611
02:22:50,875 --> 02:22:52,877
But I get that way. I get abrupt.

2612
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:55,337
Maybe you could tell him
how much I respect him.

2613
02:22:56,213 --> 02:22:58,213
I have nothing but respect for this guy.

2614
02:22:58,758 --> 02:23:00,259
I would never hurt him,

2615
02:23:00,342 --> 02:23:03,304
no matter what I do with files,
or whatever I do with anything.

2616
02:23:03,387 --> 02:23:06,808
- But you should tell him. Yourself.
- No, I'm not gonna tell him myself.

2617
02:23:06,891 --> 02:23:08,142
- Please.
- Come on.

2618
02:23:08,225 --> 02:23:10,375
- It would go a long way.
- He's your rabbi.

2619
02:23:10,936 --> 02:23:12,855
Because of him, you're here.

2620
02:23:12,938 --> 02:23:14,648
You tell him.

2621
02:23:14,732 --> 02:23:15,733
Listen to me.

2622
02:23:15,816 --> 02:23:18,319
At the end,
there's only one thing that's real.

2623
02:23:19,403 --> 02:23:21,155
This is my union.

2624
02:23:22,990 --> 02:23:25,993
This is my union, Frank.

2625
02:23:28,370 --> 02:23:30,220
Very simple when you say it that way.

2626
02:23:35,795 --> 02:23:37,004
Peggy!

2627
02:23:37,087 --> 02:23:38,631
Shall we dance?

2628
02:23:38,714 --> 02:23:40,049
Excuse us.

2629
02:24:11,914 --> 02:24:14,083
A couple of hours outside Detroit,

2630
02:24:14,166 --> 02:24:16,502
we figured we'd spend the night,

2631
02:24:16,585 --> 02:24:18,420
drive up in the morning.

2632
02:24:18,504 --> 02:24:20,504
I mean, the wedding, that was the thing.

2633
02:24:20,965 --> 02:24:24,885
Bill Bufalino was giving
his daughter away to a hell of a guy.

2634
02:24:24,969 --> 02:24:27,429
Better than the bum she was with before.

2635
02:24:27,513 --> 02:24:29,098
And that was all well and good.

2636
02:24:29,682 --> 02:24:32,977
But the wedding
was really a peace mission.

2637
02:24:34,103 --> 02:24:35,354
That's what we were there for.

2638
02:24:35,437 --> 02:24:37,231
And everybody kinda knew that,

2639
02:24:37,314 --> 02:24:39,414
and we were there
to straighten it all out.

2640
02:24:39,859 --> 02:24:41,443
- Hey, Jimmy?
- Yeah.

2641
02:24:41,527 --> 02:24:43,087
I'm with the old man, we're driving up.

2642
02:24:43,153 --> 02:24:45,698
He hopes we can straighten
this whole thing out.

2643
02:24:45,781 --> 02:24:47,450
- What did he say?
- He said he hopes

2644
02:24:47,533 --> 02:24:48,927
we can straighten it out.
After the wedding,

2645
02:24:48,951 --> 02:24:50,953
we sit down, we talk,
we straighten it out.

2646
02:24:51,036 --> 02:24:52,162
Right, the wedding.

2647
02:24:52,246 --> 02:24:53,623
I'm not going to the wedding.

2648
02:24:53,706 --> 02:24:55,833
Too many people I don't like
are gonna be there,

2649
02:24:55,916 --> 02:24:57,293
so I'm not going to the wedding.

2650
02:24:57,376 --> 02:24:58,878
You're not going to the wedding?

2651
02:24:58,961 --> 02:25:00,379
I'm not gonna be there.

2652
02:25:02,214 --> 02:25:03,632
Well, then we could...

2653
02:25:03,716 --> 02:25:05,277
Jimmy, then we could do it
anywhere you want.

2654
02:25:05,301 --> 02:25:07,386
We can do it at your house.

2655
02:25:07,469 --> 02:25:08,763
We can do it anywhere you want.

2656
02:25:08,846 --> 02:25:10,246
Wherever you're comfortable.

2657
02:25:11,056 --> 02:25:12,057
The lake?

2658
02:25:12,141 --> 02:25:14,393
Yeah, the lake.
You wanna do it at the lake?

2659
02:25:14,476 --> 02:25:18,355
From day one, I wanted to work this out.

2660
02:25:18,439 --> 02:25:21,483
- I know. I know.
- From day fucking one.

2661
02:25:21,567 --> 02:25:24,153
I know. Nobody knows better than me.
I know that.

2662
02:25:24,236 --> 02:25:25,404
All right...

2663
02:25:25,487 --> 02:25:27,323
Just you two, right?

2664
02:25:27,406 --> 02:25:29,241
I mean, not the Little Guy.

2665
02:25:29,325 --> 02:25:31,035
- No, of course, the Little Guy.
- No.

2666
02:25:31,118 --> 02:25:33,162
I'm not doing it with him.

2667
02:25:33,245 --> 02:25:34,639
Jimmy, there's no point
just the three of us.

2668
02:25:34,663 --> 02:25:35,789
No, no. No, no.

2669
02:25:35,873 --> 02:25:38,083
Just the three of us.
That's the way it's...

2670
02:25:38,167 --> 02:25:39,710
There's no point just the three of us.

2671
02:25:39,793 --> 02:25:41,104
It's gotta be the Little Guy with us.

2672
02:25:41,128 --> 02:25:43,589
No, I'm not sitting down
with that little cocksucker again!

2673
02:25:43,672 --> 02:25:46,133
Do you understand? I can't do it, Frank!

2674
02:25:46,216 --> 02:25:48,194
You have to.
No, Jimmy, you gotta sit down with him.

2675
02:25:48,218 --> 02:25:49,279
We don't gotta do anything.

2676
02:25:49,303 --> 02:25:51,472
This is a courtesy with these people.

2677
02:25:51,555 --> 02:25:52,890
A complete courtesy.

2678
02:25:52,973 --> 02:25:54,267
- You know that.
- / understand.

2679
02:25:54,350 --> 02:25:55,935
But you gotta try and move past that.

2680
02:25:56,018 --> 02:25:57,603
Get past it? I am past it!

2681
02:25:57,686 --> 02:25:59,730
I'm never seeing that motherfucker again.

2682
02:25:59,813 --> 02:26:02,149
Jimmy, you gotta sit down.
Everybody says so.

2683
02:26:02,232 --> 02:26:04,610
But there's no point.
There's only one point,

2684
02:26:04,693 --> 02:26:06,696
I don't wanna do it
and I'm not gonna do it.

2685
02:26:06,779 --> 02:26:08,281
Frank, I'm gonna hang up on you now.

2686
02:26:08,364 --> 02:26:10,366
Please. Understand this. Okay?

2687
02:26:24,213 --> 02:26:26,840
- What did he say?
- He's thinking about it.

2688
02:26:27,466 --> 02:26:29,551
- Thinking about it?
- Yeah.

2689
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:37,601
That's for you.

2690
02:26:45,818 --> 02:26:47,018
Well, that's good. Okay.

2691
02:27:00,457 --> 02:27:02,251
What time you got, Frank?

2692
02:27:02,334 --> 02:27:04,169
About 5:00.

2693
02:27:04,253 --> 02:27:05,337
5:00?

2694
02:27:07,923 --> 02:27:09,508
Maybe you should give Jimmy a call.

2695
02:27:09,591 --> 02:27:12,091
I mean, he said
he was gonna think about it, right?

2696
02:27:17,933 --> 02:27:18,934
Okay.

2697
02:27:30,029 --> 02:27:31,488
So when are you getting in?

2698
02:27:31,572 --> 02:27:32,865
Tomorrow morning.

2699
02:27:32,948 --> 02:27:34,825
That's good.
That's good, 'cause...

2700
02:27:35,409 --> 02:27:37,745
I changed my mind about the other thing.

2701
02:27:39,246 --> 02:27:41,040
- You did?
- Yeah.

2702
02:27:41,123 --> 02:27:44,376
Yeah, I'm gonna meet,
with the Little Guy tomorrow afternoon.

2703
02:27:45,419 --> 02:27:46,503
With the Little...

2704
02:27:46,587 --> 02:27:47,797
- With the Little Guy?
- Yeah.

2705
02:27:47,880 --> 02:27:50,716
Tony Jack set it up. I like Jack.

2706
02:27:50,799 --> 02:27:52,635
Jack's good. I met with him a few times

2707
02:27:52,718 --> 02:27:54,511
after that, you know, Miami fiasco.

2708
02:27:55,095 --> 02:27:56,597
With the Little Guy. Where?

2709
02:27:57,556 --> 02:28:00,642
Same place as before.
You know where it is.

2710
02:28:00,726 --> 02:28:01,894
In public.

2711
02:28:03,729 --> 02:28:05,479
You know Tony Jack is Pro's cousin?

2712
02:28:06,190 --> 02:28:07,691
Yeah. So?

2713
02:28:07,775 --> 02:28:10,225
They're all fucking cousins.
What're you gonna do?

2714
02:28:10,402 --> 02:28:12,071
Jimmy, I think I should be there.

2715
02:28:12,154 --> 02:28:13,489
Yeah, I want you there.

2716
02:28:13,572 --> 02:28:15,991
That's why I asked when you're coming in.

2717
02:28:16,075 --> 02:28:18,202
- What time's the meeting?
- 2:30.

2718
02:28:18,285 --> 02:28:20,788
And he better not be late,
that cocksucker,

2719
02:28:20,871 --> 02:28:22,831
or wearing those fucking shorts.

2720
02:28:22,915 --> 02:28:26,252
Listen, I'm gonna get there at 2:00,
so you should get there at 2:00.

2721
02:28:26,335 --> 02:28:27,545
- Okay?
- 11 be there at 2.00.

2722
02:28:27,628 --> 02:28:29,922
Good. Good. Okay.

2723
02:28:30,005 --> 02:28:31,215
I'll see you at 2:00.

2724
02:28:31,298 --> 02:28:32,798
- Thanks, Frank.
- Okay, Jimmy.

2725
02:28:34,384 --> 02:28:35,385
See you at 2:00.

2726
02:28:41,892 --> 02:28:42,893
What did he say?

2727
02:28:43,769 --> 02:28:45,019
He's gonna meet with Pro.

2728
02:28:47,231 --> 02:28:48,273
Tony Jack set it up.

2729
02:28:49,191 --> 02:28:50,275
Very good.

2730
02:29:04,873 --> 02:29:07,292
- Hello.
- Hello. Good evening.

2731
02:29:08,335 --> 02:29:10,420
- We're starving.
- Let's go, let's go.

2732
02:29:17,052 --> 02:29:18,220
It was the best move we made,

2733
02:29:18,303 --> 02:29:20,806
getting this red wine vinegar
from Angelo's guy.

2734
02:29:23,183 --> 02:29:24,476
Great Italian olive oil

2735
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:27,104
we got from that other mooch
was not bad either.

2736
02:29:28,981 --> 02:29:31,316
Catania olives, what better.

2737
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:32,734
The best.

2738
02:29:37,197 --> 02:29:38,824
There's been a change.

2739
02:29:39,408 --> 02:29:40,534
Instead of...

2740
02:29:42,244 --> 02:29:43,788
going up early, we're gonna hang around

2741
02:29:43,871 --> 02:29:46,206
tomorrow morning and then go drive up.

2742
02:29:47,166 --> 02:29:50,711
But... But I told Jimmy
that we were gonna be up in the morning.

2743
02:29:52,379 --> 02:29:53,380
I told Jimmy...

2744
02:29:53,463 --> 02:29:55,549
I told Jimmy we're gonna be
up in the morning.

2745
02:29:55,632 --> 02:29:57,176
I know. I know.

2746
02:29:59,344 --> 02:30:02,890
That I would be there for that...
meeting with Pro.

2747
02:30:02,973 --> 02:30:04,433
- What?
- That I'd be...

2748
02:30:04,516 --> 02:30:06,643
be there for that meeting with Pro.

2749
02:30:06,727 --> 02:30:07,853
Yeah. I know. I know.

2750
02:30:12,274 --> 02:30:14,484
But what I... What am I gonna do?

2751
02:30:16,862 --> 02:30:18,572
We gotta go there. I mean, I gotta go.

2752
02:30:18,655 --> 02:30:20,032
I told him I'd be there.

2753
02:30:23,619 --> 02:30:24,703
Frank...

2754
02:30:25,579 --> 02:30:27,497
we did all we could for the man.

2755
02:30:39,176 --> 02:30:40,260
Don't call him.

2756
02:31:16,713 --> 02:31:19,049
- Hey. Good morning.
- Hey. Morning.

2757
02:31:22,177 --> 02:31:23,679
Want some coffee?

2758
02:31:23,762 --> 02:31:24,805
No, I got it here.

2759
02:31:26,682 --> 02:31:28,642
- How'd ya sleep?
- Good. You?

2760
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:31,561
All right.

2761
02:31:35,691 --> 02:31:37,276
Want some Total or Corn Flakes?

2762
02:31:38,151 --> 02:31:39,528
Maybe Total.

2763
02:31:47,828 --> 02:31:49,079
That's good, thanks.

2764
02:31:56,086 --> 02:31:58,486
We're gonna take a ride
up to Port Clinton today.

2765
02:32:04,136 --> 02:32:05,686
I thought we were staying here.

2766
02:32:06,930 --> 02:32:08,630
No, the girls are gonna stay here.

2767
02:32:09,516 --> 02:32:11,310
You and me, we're going up and...

2768
02:32:12,978 --> 02:32:14,980
we'll be back three hours tops.

2769
02:32:18,108 --> 02:32:20,986
But... But what's in Port Clinton?

2770
02:32:21,695 --> 02:32:22,696
A plane.

2771
02:32:26,325 --> 02:32:27,492
A plane? To where?

2772
02:32:28,577 --> 02:32:29,578
Detroit.

2773
02:32:37,336 --> 02:32:38,754
We're going to Detroit now?

2774
02:32:39,504 --> 02:32:41,548
No, you're gonna go to Detroit.

2775
02:32:44,468 --> 02:32:46,345
And when you come back,

2776
02:32:46,428 --> 02:32:47,596
me and you,

2777
02:32:47,679 --> 02:32:51,308
we get together with the girls,
we take a nice slow drive up.

2778
02:32:52,225 --> 02:32:53,894
With cigarette breaks, you know.

2779
02:33:05,572 --> 02:33:06,698
Frank.

2780
02:33:07,324 --> 02:33:09,451
I had to put you into this thing,

2781
02:33:10,243 --> 02:33:12,162
or you would never let it happen.

2782
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:14,623
And I know you wouldn't.

2783
02:33:20,253 --> 02:33:21,755
But it's gonna happen.

2784
02:33:24,424 --> 02:33:26,134
Either way,

2785
02:33:26,218 --> 02:33:27,344
he's going.

2786
02:33:33,558 --> 02:33:35,894
I know how you feel, Frank. Trust me.

2787
02:33:35,977 --> 02:33:37,521
I know how you feel.

2788
02:33:39,356 --> 02:33:41,817
I told you before,
we tried everything to help him.

2789
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:43,151
You know that.

2790
02:33:43,235 --> 02:33:44,361
You tried.

2791
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:48,865
He brought this on himself.

2792
02:33:51,201 --> 02:33:53,036
And it's landing on us.

2793
02:33:56,915 --> 02:33:58,815
The only reason they agreed to this...

2794
02:33:59,751 --> 02:34:01,628
was out of respect to me.

2795
02:34:04,381 --> 02:34:06,258
But you and Reenie will be okay,

2796
02:34:06,967 --> 02:34:08,385
'cause you're with me.

2797
02:34:13,348 --> 02:34:14,599
You're with me.

2798
02:34:53,972 --> 02:34:55,182
Give me your glasses.

2799
02:39:22,657 --> 02:39:24,534
Hey, Frank.

2800
02:39:24,617 --> 02:39:25,618
Hey, Sal.

2801
02:39:27,912 --> 02:39:29,664
Chuckie's late.

2802
02:40:01,613 --> 02:40:02,739
- Hey.
- Hey.

2803
02:40:23,551 --> 02:40:24,552
That him?

2804
02:40:28,973 --> 02:40:29,974
Yeah.

2805
02:40:32,310 --> 02:40:33,603
Jesus.

2806
02:40:38,525 --> 02:40:39,526
I'm Sally.

2807
02:40:40,109 --> 02:40:41,110
Hi.

2808
02:40:42,779 --> 02:40:44,697
- Hey, Chuck.
- Frank.

2809
02:40:44,781 --> 02:40:46,926
Let's go. I don't want your father
yelling at me for being late.

2810
02:40:46,950 --> 02:40:48,250
Frank, you take the front.

2811
02:40:49,577 --> 02:40:51,204
- What the fuck is this?
- What?

2812
02:40:51,955 --> 02:40:52,956
It's wet.

2813
02:40:53,498 --> 02:40:57,377
Yeah, I had a frozen fish
I had to deliver for a friend of mine.

2814
02:40:58,378 --> 02:40:59,712
A fish?

2815
02:40:59,796 --> 02:41:01,089
The seat is wet from a fish?

2816
02:41:01,172 --> 02:41:02,900
Yeah, I know.
What do you want me to do about it now?

2817
02:41:02,924 --> 02:41:03,984
- Jesus Christ.
- I'll sit back there.

2818
02:41:04,008 --> 02:41:05,319
No, no, no, it's all right.
You sit in the front.

2819
02:41:05,343 --> 02:41:06,970
I'll sit there.

2820
02:41:07,053 --> 02:41:08,405
I'll sit here, you take the front.

2821
02:41:08,429 --> 02:41:09,556
No, no.

2822
02:41:09,639 --> 02:41:10,807
I'll sit there.

2823
02:41:13,893 --> 02:41:14,954
- I'm not sitting there.
- Why don't you...

2824
02:41:14,978 --> 02:41:15,979
I'm sitting there.

2825
02:41:18,606 --> 02:41:20,106
All right, sit where you want.

2826
02:41:22,443 --> 02:41:23,712
You want me to get you a newspaper, Frank?

2827
02:41:23,736 --> 02:41:25,486
It's okay. Let's go.
We gotta hurry.

2828
02:41:39,752 --> 02:41:40,753
What kind of fish?

2829
02:41:43,089 --> 02:41:44,090
What?

2830
02:41:46,426 --> 02:41:47,594
What kind of fish?

2831
02:41:49,095 --> 02:41:52,599
I don't know.
The kind you eat. A fish.

2832
02:41:53,892 --> 02:41:55,142
You don't know what kind?

2833
02:41:57,145 --> 02:41:58,313
No. I don't.

2834
02:41:59,606 --> 02:42:00,656
Where did you get it?

2835
02:42:01,983 --> 02:42:03,985
What the fuck. At a fish place.

2836
02:42:06,195 --> 02:42:09,490
What, you just go in there and say
"Gimme a fish"?

2837
02:42:10,825 --> 02:42:11,951
Pretty much. Yeah.

2838
02:42:13,745 --> 02:42:15,330
You didn't say you want a salmon,

2839
02:42:15,413 --> 02:42:19,459
you want a... haddock, you want a...
a fucking cod?

2840
02:42:19,542 --> 02:42:22,211
What the fuck does it matter
what kind of fish it was?

2841
02:42:23,004 --> 02:42:24,604
Why are you so concerned about this fish?

2842
02:42:24,631 --> 02:42:26,049
I'm just trying to understand how...

2843
02:42:26,132 --> 02:42:28,468
Does it...

2844
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:32,110
how a person can buy a fish
and not know what kind it was.

2845
02:42:34,390 --> 02:42:36,684
There was a fish waiting for me there.

2846
02:42:39,938 --> 02:42:43,191
I didn't ask what kind of fish it was.
I'm sorry.

2847
02:42:46,903 --> 02:42:48,297
So your friend
had already ordered this fish.

2848
02:42:48,321 --> 02:42:49,447
Right.

2849
02:42:55,995 --> 02:42:58,895
"Cause I wanna be able to explain this
if somebody asks me.

2850
02:43:06,047 --> 02:43:07,382
Yeah. Absolutely.

2851
02:43:20,353 --> 02:43:21,354
Dad.

2852
02:43:23,022 --> 02:43:24,023
Chuckie.

2853
02:43:24,107 --> 02:43:26,557
- Yeah, sorry I'm late. I
had to drop off — -Late?

2854
02:43:26,818 --> 02:43:28,486
What the fuck are you even doing here?

2855
02:43:28,569 --> 02:43:30,446
- Who invited you?
- Hey, Jimmy.

2856
02:43:33,157 --> 02:43:34,617
Who the fuck are you?

2857
02:43:34,701 --> 02:43:36,119
I'm with Pro.

2858
02:43:36,202 --> 02:43:37,286
You're with Pro?

2859
02:43:37,912 --> 02:43:40,248
You're with the cocksucker
who just stood me up.

2860
02:43:40,331 --> 02:43:42,459
I don't wait for anybody
more than ten minutes.

2861
02:43:42,542 --> 02:43:43,751
He's at the house.

2862
02:43:44,460 --> 02:43:45,461
What house?

2863
02:43:45,545 --> 02:43:46,796
With Russ.

2864
02:43:47,630 --> 02:43:50,216
- Russ? What the fuck is...
- Hey, look who's here.

2865
02:43:50,717 --> 02:43:52,218
- Frank.
- Jimmy.

2866
02:43:52,301 --> 02:43:54,053
What the fuck is going on?

2867
02:43:54,679 --> 02:43:56,806
I was waiting for you.
I was there at two o'clock.

2868
02:43:56,889 --> 02:43:58,033
You were supposed to show.
What happened?

2869
02:43:58,057 --> 02:44:00,935
I'm sorry.
But McGee's here, he decided to come.

2870
02:44:01,019 --> 02:44:03,219
But he ain't comfortable here.
He don't wanna come here.

2871
02:44:03,271 --> 02:44:04,272
He's at the house.

2872
02:44:04,355 --> 02:44:06,649
- McGee's in Detroit?
- Yeah, he's here.

2873
02:44:06,733 --> 02:44:07,942
He decided to come.

2874
02:44:09,736 --> 02:44:10,903
Yeah.

2875
02:44:10,987 --> 02:44:12,987
He came to help straighten this all out.

2876
02:44:14,323 --> 02:44:15,324
The house?

2877
02:44:20,997 --> 02:44:23,097
We'll bring you back after
to get your car.

2878
02:44:28,629 --> 02:44:29,881
Yeah.

2879
02:44:31,299 --> 02:44:32,550
Okay.

2880
02:44:35,678 --> 02:44:37,597
- Hey.
- Hey.

2881
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:39,057
Yeah.

2882
02:44:49,108 --> 02:44:50,193
There was a fish in here,

2883
02:44:50,276 --> 02:44:52,612
but we cleaned it up.

2884
02:44:52,695 --> 02:44:54,614
A fish?

2885
02:44:55,198 --> 02:44:57,867
Chuckie had a fucking fish in here.
Didn't even know what kind.

2886
02:44:57,950 --> 02:44:59,911
But it's okay now. I wiped it up.

2887
02:44:59,994 --> 02:45:02,872
- I got the handkerchief here.
- Yeah, I can smell it.

2888
02:45:02,955 --> 02:45:05,625
Hey, Chuckie.
You had a fish in here in your car?

2889
02:45:05,708 --> 02:45:07,418
For Bobby Holmes.

2890
02:45:07,502 --> 02:45:08,878
You know, Bobby likes fish.

2891
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:11,023
We cleaned it up, Jimmy. It's all right.

2892
02:45:11,047 --> 02:45:12,340
You cleaned it up?

2893
02:45:12,423 --> 02:45:14,258
- You cleaned it up?
- Yeah.

2894
02:45:14,342 --> 02:45:16,042
What the fuck you know about fish?

2895
02:45:16,511 --> 02:45:18,661
You ever caught
a fucking fish in your life?

2896
02:45:19,305 --> 02:45:21,974
- No.
- Well, then you don't know. See?

2897
02:45:22,475 --> 02:45:26,020
Chuck. Listen to me.
Never put a fish in your car.

2898
02:45:26,104 --> 02:45:28,439
- You never get the smell out.
- No...

2899
02:45:28,523 --> 02:45:29,625
Unless you pack it tight, you know.

2900
02:45:29,649 --> 02:45:31,192
No, I... I know.

2901
02:45:31,275 --> 02:45:32,861
- You know? Remember that.
- Right.

2902
02:45:32,944 --> 02:45:33,945
I know.

2903
02:45:34,028 --> 02:45:35,363
It'll help you in life.

2904
02:45:40,868 --> 02:45:43,621
Frank, you couldn't come by
at 2:00 and tell me this?

2905
02:45:43,704 --> 02:45:46,666
I was waiting there 40 minutes
like a fuckin' moron.

2906
02:45:46,749 --> 02:45:49,502
Jimmy, I'm sorry.
I came as soon as I got here.

2907
02:45:49,585 --> 02:45:51,065
- You got in this morning.
- No, no, no.

2908
02:45:51,129 --> 02:45:52,297
I got here this afternoon.

2909
02:45:52,380 --> 02:45:55,175
Russell had business in Port Clinton.
I had to wait for him.

2910
02:45:55,258 --> 02:45:56,759
He reminded me. I forgot.

2911
02:45:56,843 --> 02:45:58,970
So, we had to come
and as soon as we got here,

2912
02:45:59,053 --> 02:46:00,596
I came right here to see you.

2913
02:46:00,680 --> 02:46:02,765
All due respect to Russ, you know...

2914
02:46:03,808 --> 02:46:06,811
but somebody should have come tell me,
you know.

2915
02:46:06,894 --> 02:46:10,523
Just come tell me it's 2:30,
2:40, at the very least.

2916
02:46:10,606 --> 02:46:11,667
You're not incorrect. I mean...

2917
02:46:11,691 --> 02:46:15,862
Who the fuck is Pro?
He sends a fucking errand boy here.

2918
02:46:15,945 --> 02:46:16,988
He ain't stayin'.

2919
02:46:17,071 --> 02:46:18,156
I know he ain't staying.

2920
02:46:18,239 --> 02:46:20,325
That's not the point,
he's staying or not staying.

2921
02:46:20,408 --> 02:46:21,868
The point is Pro sent him.

2922
02:46:21,951 --> 02:46:23,244
You know?

2923
02:46:23,327 --> 02:46:24,847
Point is,
he should've come picked me up himself.

2924
02:46:24,871 --> 02:46:26,271
That's the point I'm makin'.

2925
02:46:29,667 --> 02:46:31,567
Can you even see out of those glasses?

2926
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:34,839
I can't see a fucking thing.

2927
02:46:34,922 --> 02:46:37,222
That's good.
I'm glad you're not driving, then.

2928
02:46:45,808 --> 02:46:47,608
Yeah, it's right... It's right up...

2929
02:46:48,060 --> 02:46:49,938
It's right up here. Right... Right up...

2930
02:46:50,021 --> 02:46:51,671
That building with the staircase.

2931
02:46:53,566 --> 02:46:54,626
You got your friend with you?

2932
02:46:54,650 --> 02:46:56,569
- Right here.
- Good.

2933
02:46:57,486 --> 02:46:59,363
You never know with this cocksucker,

2934
02:46:59,447 --> 02:47:00,948
with or without Russ there.

2935
02:47:40,821 --> 02:47:42,671
Let's get outta here, Frank. Come on.

2936
02:50:18,229 --> 02:50:18,664
James Hoffa,
former president of the Teamsters Union,

2937
02:50:18,688 --> 02:50:21,065
James Hoffa,
former president of the Teamsters Union,

2938
02:50:21,148 --> 02:50:22,566
disappeared on Wednesday.

2939
02:50:22,650 --> 02:50:25,403
And as of tonight,
no trace of him has been found.

2940
02:50:25,486 --> 02:50:27,154
Hoffa spent four years...

2941
02:50:27,238 --> 02:50:28,531
In prison and made no bones

2942
02:50:28,614 --> 02:50:29,824
- about his intention...
- Frank.

2943
02:50:29,907 --> 02:50:33,285
To get the presidency back
from his successor, Frank Fitzsimmons.

2944
02:50:33,369 --> 02:50:35,413
Fitzsimmons' son
Is the vice president of...

2945
02:50:35,496 --> 02:50:37,581
Still nothing?

2946
02:50:37,665 --> 02:50:40,918
Young Fitzsimmons' car
was bombed. He was not in it

2947
02:50:41,001 --> 02:50:44,213
But there is bad blood
in the Detroit Local.

2948
02:50:44,296 --> 02:50:47,049
Hoffa disappeared Wednesday afternoon.

2949
02:50:47,133 --> 02:50:50,594
Now, more than 48 hours later,
with no word yet

2950
02:50:50,678 --> 02:50:54,473
on what happened to Hoffa,
police are extremely concerned.

2951
02:50:54,557 --> 02:50:57,143
<i>Authorities are most anxious
to find whom Hoffa</i>

2952
02:50:57,226 --> 02:51:00,020
was supposed to meet
outside the Red Fox restaurant

2953
02:51:00,104 --> 02:51:01,689
where he was last seen.

2954
02:51:02,273 --> 02:51:05,818
Police think it could have been
a man named Anthony Giacalone,

2955
02:51:05,901 --> 02:51:08,571
described as a big man
in the Detroit Mafia.

2956
02:51:08,654 --> 02:51:11,740
Hoffa's son, James,
tried to contact Giacalone today,

2957
02:51:11,824 --> 02:51:13,242
but didn't succeed.

2958
02:51:13,325 --> 02:51:15,327
Hoffa's family and friends stayed

2959
02:51:15,411 --> 02:51:17,372
in the family home in Lake Orion today...

2960
02:51:17,455 --> 02:51:19,081
I should call Jo.

2961
02:51:21,041 --> 02:51:22,585
You haven't called Jo yet?

2962
02:51:29,425 --> 02:51:30,676
Why?

2963
02:51:31,218 --> 02:51:32,219
What?

2964
02:51:33,262 --> 02:51:34,263
Why?

2965
02:51:35,890 --> 02:51:36,891
Why what?

2966
02:51:38,976 --> 02:51:40,276
Why haven't you called Jo?

2967
02:51:41,270 --> 02:51:42,271
Has anybody come forward

2968
02:51:42,354 --> 02:51:44,107
with a ransom demand
or anything like that?

2969
02:51:44,190 --> 02:51:45,608
Not as of yet.

2970
02:51:45,691 --> 02:51:48,319
Do you think the abduction was for ransom?

2971
02:51:48,903 --> 02:51:50,321
I'm gonna call her now.

2972
02:51:51,822 --> 02:51:52,865
Do you think the abduction

2973
02:51:52,948 --> 02:51:55,910
<i>had anything to do
with the recent conflicts</i>

2974
02:51:55,993 --> 02:51:58,037
within Local 299, his own Local?

2975
02:51:58,120 --> 02:52:00,331
/ think the union politics

2976
02:52:00,414 --> 02:52:02,417
Is certainly something
that has to be investigated.

2977
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:04,877
One high official
of the Teamsters International

2978
02:52:04,960 --> 02:52:06,670
says he fears the worst,

2979
02:52:06,754 --> 02:52:08,672
that Hoffa may have been killed.

2980
02:52:09,507 --> 02:52:12,760
Robert Hager, NBC News,
Bloomfield, Michigan.

2981
02:52:14,386 --> 02:52:16,264
<i>Newscaster At a truck stop
outside Detroit,</i>

2982
02:52:16,347 --> 02:52:19,183
where Hoffa rose to the top
in the Teamsters Union,

2983
02:52:19,266 --> 02:52:21,602
<i>truck drivers had a variety of theories...</i>

2984
02:52:21,685 --> 02:52:24,396
She stopped talking to me that day.

2985
02:52:24,480 --> 02:52:27,149
August 3rd, 1975.

2986
02:52:28,692 --> 02:52:32,863
She's got a good job now
and lives just outside Philly.

2987
02:52:34,365 --> 02:52:35,783
But my daughter...

2988
02:52:36,742 --> 02:52:37,743
Peggy...

2989
02:52:38,702 --> 02:52:39,870
disappeared...

2990
02:52:41,372 --> 02:52:42,915
from my life that day.

2991
02:52:46,919 --> 02:52:47,920
Hello.

2992
02:52:50,089 --> 02:52:51,298
- Hello.
- Hello?

2993
02:52:51,799 --> 02:52:53,467
Jo. Jo?

2994
02:52:54,802 --> 02:52:56,262
It's... It's...

2995
02:52:56,345 --> 02:52:58,722
- Frank. Frank?
- Yeah. Yeah.

2996
02:52:59,723 --> 02:53:01,642
- Yeah, um...
- / don'...

2997
02:53:02,476 --> 02:53:04,562
- Look, I...
- Frank...

2998
02:53:05,396 --> 02:53:07,773
Do you think...
Do you think he's alive?

2999
02:53:10,568 --> 02:53:11,819
He's gotta be.

3000
02:53:13,195 --> 02:53:14,906
You know, you gotta think positively.

3001
02:53:14,989 --> 02:53:17,200
It's just, you know, it ain't that long.
It's just...

3002
02:53:17,283 --> 02:53:18,534
But do you...

3003
02:53:19,034 --> 02:53:20,327
Do you know he's okay?

3004
02:53:20,411 --> 02:53:22,955
No, no, no, I mean, you know me, I...

3005
02:53:23,038 --> 02:53:25,958
He maybe did something
like the Joe Bananas thing,

3006
02:53:26,041 --> 02:53:29,044
where, you know, he had himself kidnapped

3007
02:53:29,128 --> 02:53:32,423
and then came back,
but he wasn't hurt, nothing happened.

3008
02:53:32,506 --> 02:53:34,300
Maybe he...

3009
02:53:34,383 --> 02:53:35,635
Maybe he just felt, you know,

3010
02:53:35,718 --> 02:53:37,428
he wanted to clear his head a bit.

3011
02:53:37,511 --> 02:53:39,761
But you gotta just think
that it's gonna be...

3012
02:53:40,514 --> 02:53:41,932
It's gonna be okay.

3013
02:53:42,725 --> 02:53:44,310
It's gonna be okay.

3014
02:53:45,978 --> 02:53:47,396
He's gonna be...

3015
02:53:48,606 --> 02:53:51,358
If you need anything, I'm here for you.

3016
02:53:51,442 --> 02:53:54,528
Anything. Anything.

3017
02:53:54,612 --> 02:53:56,488
Can you just...
Can you call me again?

3018
02:53:56,572 --> 02:53:58,699
Yeah, I'll call... I'll call you.

3019
02:54:00,326 --> 02:54:01,827
Yeah, I'll... I'll call you.

3020
02:54:02,995 --> 02:54:04,997
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

3021
02:54:05,080 --> 02:54:06,665
Yes, call me tomorrow.

3022
02:54:06,749 --> 02:54:09,168
Okay. I'll call you in the morning, okay?

3023
02:54:09,251 --> 02:54:11,962
- Promise?
- Don't worry. Be strong.

3024
02:54:12,046 --> 02:54:13,380
Be positive?

3025
02:54:14,381 --> 02:54:16,592
Okay, Jo, okay, okay.

3026
02:54:17,384 --> 02:54:18,677
Okay.

3027
02:54:18,761 --> 02:54:20,721
- Okay.
- Talk to ya a little later. Bye.

3028
02:54:20,804 --> 02:54:22,723
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Frank.

3029
02:55:21,907 --> 02:55:24,660
It was no more complicated than that.

3030
02:55:26,453 --> 02:55:27,871
Mr. Sheeran,

3031
02:55:28,664 --> 02:55:30,791
do you know who, if anyone,

3032
02:55:30,874 --> 02:55:33,627
was behind the disappearance
of James Hoffa?

3033
02:55:33,711 --> 02:55:37,172
Everybody who ever had
anything to do with Jimmy

3034
02:55:37,256 --> 02:55:39,007
was hauled in and questioned.

3035
02:55:39,091 --> 02:55:40,134
On the advice of counsel,

3036
02:55:40,217 --> 02:55:42,261
I respectfully decline
to answer that question

3037
02:55:42,344 --> 02:55:44,764
on the grounds
that it might tend to incriminate me.

3038
02:55:44,847 --> 02:55:46,181
Okay, let me ask you this:

3039
02:55:46,890 --> 02:55:48,142
what color is my pen?

3040
02:55:50,769 --> 02:55:52,021
And everybody took the Fifth.

3041
02:55:52,104 --> 02:55:53,772
I mean, in that situation,

3042
02:55:54,481 --> 02:55:56,525
that's what you do.
What else are you gonna do?

3043
02:55:56,608 --> 02:55:59,695
Still, everybody got indicted or convicted

3044
02:55:59,778 --> 02:56:01,196
on one thing or another,

3045
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:02,406
but not that.

3046
02:56:02,489 --> 02:56:03,824
Not about Jimmy.

3047
02:56:03,907 --> 02:56:06,869
Nobody, as you know,
even went to jail for that.

3048
02:56:06,952 --> 02:56:08,912
<i>And nobody talked, which is unusual,</i>

3049
02:56:08,996 --> 02:56:11,582
cause usually,
three people can keep a secret

3050
02:56:11,665 --> 02:56:13,500
only when two of them are dead.

3051
02:56:15,502 --> 02:56:18,046
Bruno Denzetta and Marco Rossi,

3052
02:56:18,130 --> 02:56:21,508
they got 20 years each
for shaking down a trucking company.

3053
02:56:22,718 --> 02:56:25,804
Pro was convicted with them,
but he was already back in school

3054
02:56:25,888 --> 02:56:28,265
for that other matter
I talked about before.

3055
02:56:28,348 --> 02:56:30,184
Well, you remember
that poor union treasurer,

3056
02:56:30,267 --> 02:56:33,061
Tony "Three Fingers,"
who got more votes than Pro?

3057
02:56:33,145 --> 02:56:34,772
They got him on that.

3058
02:56:34,855 --> 02:56:38,150
Sally Bugs, you know, he did that one.

3059
02:56:43,989 --> 02:56:47,367
One day, Bugs was seen
walking into the Federal building.

3060
02:56:48,952 --> 02:56:50,652
What he did itself ain't no crime.

3061
02:56:51,163 --> 02:56:53,832
I mean, a lot of people
get called in for things.

3062
02:56:53,916 --> 02:56:56,293
But Sally knows better.

3063
02:56:56,376 --> 02:56:58,629
How come he didn't say anything
to anybody?

3064
02:56:59,838 --> 02:57:02,007
He didn't tell anybody one word.

3065
02:57:02,090 --> 02:57:03,592
Not one word.

3066
02:57:04,927 --> 02:57:06,678
And one thing for sure,

3067
02:57:07,513 --> 02:57:09,681
he didn't go there for fucking lunch.

3068
02:57:22,653 --> 02:57:23,654
Sally.

3069
02:57:24,696 --> 02:57:26,490
- What's good?
- Hey, Irish.

3070
02:57:38,752 --> 02:57:42,298
<i>(Frank) Turns out Sally did tell somebody
he had to go in there for something.</i>

3071
02:57:42,381 --> 02:57:43,966
<i>They just forgot to tell somebody else.</i>

3072
02:57:44,049 --> 02:57:46,343
So it was a bad hit.

3073
02:57:49,179 --> 02:57:51,223
Jimmy's son, Chuckie,
you know, his foster son,

3074
02:57:51,306 --> 02:57:52,808
was in the thing, too,

3075
02:57:52,891 --> 02:57:54,226
but he didn't know it

3076
02:57:55,269 --> 02:57:57,396
All Chuckie knew was he was pickin' up

3077
02:57:57,479 --> 02:57:59,064
one of Pro's guys and me,

3078
02:57:59,147 --> 02:58:03,235
and we was all gonna pick up his dad
at the Red Fox for a meeting.

3079
02:58:03,861 --> 02:58:07,573
Well, I mean, he was in it, yeah,
you could say that, but stupidly.

3080
02:58:08,365 --> 02:58:11,243
I... I always felt sorry
for Chuckie in this whole thing.

3081
02:58:11,326 --> 02:58:12,953
And I... I still do.

3082
02:58:13,036 --> 02:58:14,413
And the Feds gave him ten months

3083
02:58:14,496 --> 02:58:17,249
for some bullshit thing about a car,
and that's about it.

3084
02:58:17,332 --> 02:58:18,834
Who knows what the fuck...

3085
02:58:20,752 --> 02:58:23,839
Fat Tony Salerno,
they got on an income tax thing.

3086
02:58:24,756 --> 02:58:28,468
A little while after,
he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

3087
02:58:32,347 --> 02:58:35,475
There's a... a pork store up in...

3088
02:58:37,477 --> 02:58:39,354
northern California.

3089
02:58:40,188 --> 02:58:41,940
Right around...

3090
02:58:43,108 --> 02:58:45,360
Walnut Creek.
You're from up there, ain't you?

3091
02:58:46,069 --> 02:58:47,571
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

3092
02:58:47,654 --> 02:58:49,854
And you might even know
the guy that runs it.

3093
02:58:50,532 --> 02:58:53,118
Actually,
I'm looking for a little favor...

3094
02:58:53,201 --> 02:58:54,995
for him, not for me.

3095
02:58:55,954 --> 02:58:59,708
But if you can get him a ticket,
like, to Australia...

3096
02:59:01,209 --> 02:59:02,544
You know what I mean.

3097
02:59:05,047 --> 02:59:06,214
Yeah.

3098
02:59:07,674 --> 02:59:09,676
You want to help him get down there?

3099
02:59:15,223 --> 02:59:16,350
Ye... Yeah.

3100
02:59:16,433 --> 02:59:17,976
Mow, Russell, he got pinched

3101
02:59:18,060 --> 02:59:21,021
for telling Jimmy the Weasel
to strangle Jack Napoli

3102
02:59:21,104 --> 02:59:23,649
over some beef about 25 grand of jewelry

3103
02:59:23,732 --> 02:59:25,233
that Jack took on credit

3104
02:59:25,317 --> 02:59:28,195
from Russell and then he never paid for.

3105
02:59:28,278 --> 02:59:30,697
Now, with Russ, you don't do that.

3106
02:59:31,865 --> 02:59:35,077
So, only thing is, the Weasel, he flipped.

3107
02:59:35,160 --> 02:59:36,745
He had a wire on him.

3108
02:59:36,828 --> 02:59:39,623
They called it
“conspiracy to kill a witness."

3109
02:59:39,706 --> 02:59:42,710
<i>It was obvious to everybody else
that Napoli was clearly in the wrong.</i>

3110
02:59:42,793 --> 02:59:44,920
I mean, how could you not see that?

3111
02:59:45,003 --> 02:59:46,838
He set him up. It was entrapment.

3112
02:59:46,922 --> 02:59:48,382
What else could you call it?

3113
02:59:48,465 --> 02:59:52,427
But that's another thing
I don't wanna get into now.

3114
02:59:52,511 --> 02:59:53,512
Raise your right hand.

3115
02:59:53,595 --> 02:59:56,890
They brought me up on bribery
and labor racketeering charges

3116
02:59:56,974 --> 02:59:58,694
and some other bullshit things
I don't know.

3117
02:59:58,725 --> 03:00:00,019
The truth, the whole truth

3118
03:00:00,102 --> 03:00:01,186
and nothing but the truth,

3119
03:00:01,269 --> 03:00:02,437
So help you God?
I do.

3120
03:00:02,521 --> 03:00:04,815
Did you also tell them that Mr. Boffa

3121
03:00:04,898 --> 03:00:06,901
had given you and your wife
luxury vehicles?

3122
03:00:06,984 --> 03:00:10,112
Mr. Cole, I worked for 44 years,

3123
03:00:10,195 --> 03:00:14,616
I never took one dime illegally
off Boffa or nobody else.

3124
03:00:14,700 --> 03:00:17,119
You can think whatever you wanna think.
Don't matter to me.

3125
03:00:17,202 --> 03:00:20,163
But all they got me for was
blowing up a crane company

3126
03:00:20,247 --> 03:00:22,249
that fired two of my shop stewards

3127
03:00:22,332 --> 03:00:23,667
for no good reason.

3128
03:00:26,128 --> 03:00:27,879
And... And my Lincoln.

3129
03:00:28,505 --> 03:00:31,091
I mean,
I bought that car from Eugene Boffa.

3130
03:00:31,967 --> 03:00:34,302
He leased truck drivers
to freight companies,

3131
03:00:34,386 --> 03:00:37,347
and then he paid them substandard wages.

3132
03:00:39,349 --> 03:00:41,560
<i>They said I paid a lot less for the car</i>

3133
03:00:41,643 --> 03:00:43,103
than what it was worth.

3134
03:00:43,687 --> 03:00:45,647
They said the car was a bribe.

3135
03:00:51,778 --> 03:00:53,780
L.. I... I loved that car.

3136
03:00:54,489 --> 03:00:58,160
But it wasn't worth the 18 years
they gave me for it.

3137
03:00:58,243 --> 03:00:59,536
That's for sure.

3138
03:01:04,458 --> 03:01:06,710
Russell, he had a stroke.

3139
03:01:06,793 --> 03:01:10,255
Fat Tony, he couldn't control
his urine no more.

3140
03:01:10,338 --> 03:01:12,257
And my arthritis

3141
03:01:12,340 --> 03:01:15,010
that started in the foxholes of Anzio

3142
03:01:15,093 --> 03:01:17,679
was eatin' away at my lower back now,

3143
03:01:17,763 --> 03:01:20,140
and I couldn't feel much
in my feet no more.

3144
03:01:20,807 --> 03:01:22,142
I needed a cane.

3145
03:01:22,225 --> 03:01:24,812
But, you know, they're not gonna
give you a cane in the can

3146
03:01:24,895 --> 03:01:27,647
because they say
you're gonna use it as a weapon.

3147
03:01:27,731 --> 03:01:29,483
There was this medicine, Neurontin,

3148
03:01:29,566 --> 03:01:32,778
it helped me a little bit,
but it also made you loopy.

3149
03:01:32,861 --> 03:01:34,154
He's got it!

3150
03:01:34,237 --> 03:01:35,655
He's got it!

3151
03:01:36,907 --> 03:01:38,347
We were all falling apart right there

3152
03:01:38,408 --> 03:01:39,993
in the freezing fucking cold.

3153
03:01:40,077 --> 03:01:41,804
- I can see it from here.
- You getting scared now?

3154
03:01:41,828 --> 03:01:43,747
Yeah, you stay here
another fucking ten years,

3155
03:01:43,830 --> 03:01:44,873
you'll beat me.

3156
03:01:54,091 --> 03:01:55,592
Is this the good grape juice?

3157
03:02:08,355 --> 03:02:09,815
I can't eat it.

3158
03:02:10,315 --> 03:02:12,317
- Take a bite.
- I got no teeth. I can't.

3159
03:02:12,400 --> 03:02:13,527
Put a little piece.

3160
03:02:14,111 --> 03:02:15,338
Just a little piece, thank you.

3161
03:02:15,362 --> 03:02:16,488
That's it?

3162
03:02:30,168 --> 03:02:31,878
- E buono, no?
- Buono.

3163
03:02:31,962 --> 03:02:34,005
Buono.

3164
03:02:38,009 --> 03:02:39,719
Jimmy was a good man.

3165
03:02:40,428 --> 03:02:42,806
You know?
He had a nice family too?

3166
03:02:43,974 --> 03:02:44,975
Yeah.

3167
03:02:45,559 --> 03:02:47,561
- Yeah.
- I know.

3168
03:02:49,312 --> 03:02:51,773
I never wanted it to go that far.

3169
03:03:00,991 --> 03:03:03,660
I picked us over him.

3170
03:03:04,536 --> 03:03:05,537
Fuck 'em.

3171
03:03:06,746 --> 03:03:07,998
Fuck 'em.

3172
03:03:09,791 --> 03:03:10,834
Fuck 'em.

3173
03:03:16,715 --> 03:03:20,218
Mangia che cresci... figlio mio, mangia.

3174
03:03:35,567 --> 03:03:36,860
Hey, Russ.

3175
03:03:36,943 --> 03:03:38,069
Hey, Frankie.

3176
03:03:38,153 --> 03:03:39,988
- Where you goin'?
- What?

3177
03:03:40,071 --> 03:03:42,365
- Where you goin'?
- I'm going to church.

3178
03:03:42,949 --> 03:03:43,950
Church?

3179
03:03:44,451 --> 03:03:46,244
Don't laugh, you'll see.

3180
03:03:46,328 --> 03:03:47,412
Don't laugh.

3181
03:03:47,996 --> 03:03:49,080
You'll see.

3182
03:03:57,047 --> 03:03:58,798
Russell went to church.

3183
03:04:00,926 --> 03:04:04,054
Then he went to the prison hospital.

3184
03:04:06,181 --> 03:04:07,182
And...

3185
03:04:07,265 --> 03:04:09,559
And then he went to the graveyard.

3186
03:04:12,270 --> 03:04:15,523
Lord Jesus Christ, by your own...

3187
03:04:15,607 --> 03:04:17,484
I got out that October.

3188
03:04:17,567 --> 03:04:19,444
Reenie died in December.

3189
03:04:20,070 --> 03:04:22,614
On December 23rd, to be exact.

3190
03:04:23,240 --> 03:04:24,241
Lung cancer.

3191
03:04:24,824 --> 03:04:25,951
No surprise.

3192
03:04:26,993 --> 03:04:29,454
Even as it claims our mortal bodies.

3193
03:04:30,163 --> 03:04:33,041
Grant that our sister
may sleep here in peace,

3194
03:04:33,124 --> 03:04:35,293
until you awaken her to glory.

3195
03:04:36,169 --> 03:04:38,755
For you are the resurrection and the life.

3196
03:04:38,838 --> 03:04:41,383
And then she will see you face to face,

3197
03:04:41,466 --> 03:04:43,927
and in your light will see light,

3198
03:04:44,010 --> 03:04:46,513
and know the splendor of God

3199
03:04:46,596 --> 03:04:49,224
for ever and ever. Amen.

3200
03:05:22,382 --> 03:05:27,262
Six points shy
of his career average of .296

3201
03:05:27,345 --> 03:05:29,014
coming into this season.

3202
03:05:29,097 --> 03:05:33,935
Top four batters in this lineup for
Philadelphia today are all switch hitters.

3203
03:06:28,114 --> 03:06:30,742
Much to the frustration
of some policy makers,

3204
03:06:30,825 --> 03:06:33,620
NATO military leaders will not risk

3205
03:06:33,703 --> 03:06:36,915
low flying attacks
on Serb troops in Kosovo.

3206
03:06:38,541 --> 03:06:42,420
It could take days more
of systematic bombing, especially since

3207
03:06:42,504 --> 03:06:46,132
the Serbs have hidden so many
of their anti-aircraft missiles,

3208
03:06:46,216 --> 03:06:48,551
in essence, daring NATO to fly low.

3209
03:07:12,033 --> 03:07:14,244
You go... you go there. Yeah, yeah.

3210
03:07:14,828 --> 03:07:15,829
Yeah, yeah.

3211
03:07:25,004 --> 03:07:26,423
Peggy.

3212
03:07:26,506 --> 03:07:28,967
Peggy. I just want to talk.

3213
03:07:50,780 --> 03:07:52,740
I just, you know... I...

3214
03:07:52,824 --> 03:07:53,950
She walked away.

3215
03:07:55,326 --> 03:07:57,912
I know she's mad at me and all,
but I... I want...

3216
03:07:57,996 --> 03:08:00,748
Call her. Call her.
I just want to talk to her.

3217
03:08:02,208 --> 03:08:04,002
Talk to her and tell her what?

3218
03:08:04,085 --> 03:08:05,712
What...

3219
03:08:05,795 --> 03:08:07,922
I just want to say I'm sorry. That's all.

3220
03:08:09,507 --> 03:08:10,508
For?

3221
03:08:12,969 --> 03:08:13,970
Look...

3222
03:08:15,221 --> 03:08:18,183
I know I wasn't a... a good dad.
I know that.

3223
03:08:18,266 --> 03:08:20,768
I know that.
I was just trying to protect her.

3224
03:08:20,852 --> 03:08:22,103
Protect all of youse.

3225
03:08:22,187 --> 03:08:24,606
I mean, that's what I was doing.
That's...

3226
03:08:25,773 --> 03:08:26,774
From what?

3227
03:08:27,817 --> 03:08:28,902
Well, everything.

3228
03:08:29,569 --> 03:08:30,945
I mean...

3229
03:08:31,029 --> 03:08:34,491
You... Youse had
a sheltered life, in a way,

3230
03:08:34,574 --> 03:08:36,076
because you didn't see what I see

3231
03:08:36,159 --> 03:08:37,785
and what I've been through.

3232
03:08:40,497 --> 03:08:42,290
There's a lot of bad people out there.

3233
03:08:42,373 --> 03:08:44,334
What else am I gonna do?

3234
03:08:44,417 --> 03:08:47,337
Daddy, you have no idea
what it was like for us.

3235
03:08:49,130 --> 03:08:50,816
I mean, we couldn't go to you
with a problem

3236
03:08:50,840 --> 03:08:52,300
'cause of what you would do.

3237
03:08:52,383 --> 03:08:54,761
You know,
we couldn't come to you for protection

3238
03:08:54,844 --> 03:08:57,244
because of the terrible things
that you would do.

3239
03:09:00,016 --> 03:09:01,810
I was just... I was...
I didn't want to see

3240
03:09:01,893 --> 03:09:04,020
youse get hurt, that's all.

3241
03:09:04,729 --> 03:09:05,730
Um...

3242
03:09:08,650 --> 03:09:11,611
I know you read a lot of things about me,
heard about 'em.

3243
03:09:11,694 --> 03:09:12,779
I'm sorry.

3244
03:09:13,279 --> 03:09:14,322
L... um...

3245
03:09:16,324 --> 03:09:19,160
Can I do anything now
to make it up to you?

3246
03:09:31,297 --> 03:09:33,692
If you're looking for something
with a little bit more luxury,

3247
03:09:33,716 --> 03:09:35,927
we have these two models over here.

3248
03:09:36,010 --> 03:09:38,137
They're like the Cadillacs of caskets.

3249
03:09:38,680 --> 03:09:40,324
Now, if we puttin' you
in the fuckin' oven,

3250
03:09:40,348 --> 03:09:42,348
it really doesn't matter what you go in.

3251
03:09:42,642 --> 03:09:43,977
The cheapest shit possible.

3252
03:09:44,060 --> 03:09:45,895
Particle board, that's it.

3253
03:09:45,979 --> 03:09:48,429
What are we doin' today?
Are we doin' a cremation?

3254
03:09:49,190 --> 03:09:51,067
- A burial.
- Burial?

3255
03:09:51,651 --> 03:09:53,195
Is it for a man or for a woman?

3256
03:09:53,278 --> 03:09:54,279
Me.

3257
03:09:55,321 --> 03:09:56,573
Shit.

3258
03:10:01,119 --> 03:10:02,419
You see anything you like?

3259
03:10:13,756 --> 03:10:15,758
- That green one.
- That's a beauty.

3260
03:10:15,842 --> 03:10:18,261
That one'll set you back about $7,500

3261
03:10:18,344 --> 03:10:19,644
if you take it home today.

3262
03:10:20,430 --> 03:10:21,764
What do you think?

3263
03:10:23,016 --> 03:10:24,392
Can you do any better?

3264
03:10:25,143 --> 03:10:29,230
I mean, buddy,
this is what you want to go home in, no?

3265
03:10:30,565 --> 03:10:33,818
I think we could go six
on that for you. How about that?

3266
03:10:34,569 --> 03:10:36,946
- Six flat cash work for you?
- That's good.

3267
03:10:38,114 --> 03:10:39,115
Good for me.

3268
03:10:59,177 --> 03:11:00,887
Sooner or later,

3269
03:11:00,970 --> 03:11:03,973
everybody put here has a date
when he's gonna go.

3270
03:11:04,057 --> 03:11:05,558
That's just the way it is.

3271
03:11:06,809 --> 03:11:10,647
And I think there's gotta be
something when you go

3272
03:11:11,314 --> 03:11:15,777
cause, I mean, how the hell
aid this whole thing start?

3273
03:11:19,739 --> 03:11:22,241
People smarter than me
can't figure it out.

3274
03:11:22,325 --> 03:11:25,036
That's why I would never go for cremation
because its so...

3275
03:11:25,119 --> 03:11:26,454
it's so final,

3276
03:11:28,331 --> 03:11:29,582
This... This one.

3277
03:11:31,084 --> 03:11:32,418
1948.

3278
03:11:33,753 --> 03:11:36,756
That's the hardest part
of anybody when they bury youse,

3279
03:11:36,839 --> 03:11:39,717
Is when they go into the ground
because its...

3280
03:11:39,801 --> 03:11:40,927
it's so final,

3281
03:11:42,261 --> 03:11:44,847
If you go into a building,
the building's there.

3282
03:11:44,931 --> 03:11:46,349
The crypt is there.

3283
03:11:46,432 --> 03:11:48,101
It has to be a metal casket,

3284
03:11:48,184 --> 03:11:49,686
and they have you in the room.

3285
03:11:50,186 --> 03:11:51,521
And all that there.

3286
03:11:51,604 --> 03:11:53,398
It's just not as final. You're dead,

3287
03:11:53,481 --> 03:11:55,650
but it ain't that final.

3288
03:11:58,986 --> 03:12:02,115
I'm sorry, but I gotta direct youse

3289
03:12:02,198 --> 03:12:04,575
to my attorney, Mr. Ragano...

3290
03:12:06,452 --> 03:12:08,871
if youse want to talk about
Mr. Hoffa or...

3291
03:12:09,580 --> 03:12:11,582
or any matter, for that matter.

3292
03:12:11,666 --> 03:12:13,376
I got noth... nothing new to say.

3293
03:12:14,585 --> 03:12:16,379
He's dead.

3294
03:12:16,462 --> 03:12:18,172
Who's dead?

3295
03:12:18,256 --> 03:12:19,716
Your attorney, Mr. Ragano.

3296
03:12:19,799 --> 03:12:20,800
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

3297
03:12:20,883 --> 03:12:21,884
Who did it?

3298
03:12:23,678 --> 03:12:24,679
Cancer.

3299
03:12:27,432 --> 03:12:29,267
Everybody's dead, Mr. Sheeran.

3300
03:12:31,144 --> 03:12:32,145
It's over.

3301
03:12:32,812 --> 03:12:33,813
They're all gone.

3302
03:12:33,896 --> 03:12:36,399
Russell, Angelo, Salerno,

3303
03:12:36,482 --> 03:12:39,652
Pro, Dorfman, Sally Bugs.
They're gone.

3304
03:12:41,696 --> 03:12:42,905
Who are you protecting?

3305
03:12:45,074 --> 03:12:46,451
You know who's not gone?

3306
03:12:47,994 --> 03:12:50,288
Mr. Hoffa's family. His children.

3307
03:12:50,997 --> 03:12:53,958
They're here.
And they gotta live not knowing.

3308
03:12:55,501 --> 03:12:56,544
That's hard to do.

3309
03:12:59,547 --> 03:13:00,947
I mean, you got kids, Frank.

3310
03:13:01,799 --> 03:13:02,842
Can you imagine?

3311
03:13:08,598 --> 03:13:11,684
Frank, it's time.
It's time you say what happened.

3312
03:13:18,608 --> 03:13:20,610
You seem like nice fellas.

3313
03:13:21,444 --> 03:13:23,446
I appreciate youse coming to see me.

3314
03:13:24,280 --> 03:13:25,990
But I... I can't help you.

3315
03:13:29,827 --> 03:13:31,704
- That's it?
- That's it.

3316
03:13:38,753 --> 03:13:41,297
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

3317
03:13:41,380 --> 03:13:42,549
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

3318
03:13:42,632 --> 03:13:43,692
- Pray for us sinners...
- Pray for us sinners...

3319
03:13:43,716 --> 03:13:45,194
- Pray for us sinners...
- Pray for us sinners...

3320
03:13:45,218 --> 03:13:48,346
Now and at the hour of our death.

3321
03:13:48,971 --> 03:13:50,598
- Amen.
- Amen.

3322
03:13:53,434 --> 03:13:54,519
That was...

3323
03:13:55,144 --> 03:13:56,729
That wasn't too bad.

3324
03:13:56,813 --> 03:13:57,939
It's been a while.

3325
03:13:58,022 --> 03:13:59,649
Not bad at all.

3326
03:13:59,732 --> 03:14:02,360
And the intention was there.
The intention.

3327
03:14:02,443 --> 03:14:03,528
I know.

3328
03:14:04,195 --> 03:14:05,905
I know the intention is there.

3329
03:14:05,988 --> 03:14:07,323
It was there, Father.

3330
03:14:09,116 --> 03:14:11,118
Do you feel anything for...

3331
03:14:11,202 --> 03:14:13,371
for what you've done?

3332
03:14:16,916 --> 03:14:20,253
I, I don't. I mean, maybe that...

3333
03:14:21,379 --> 03:14:23,506
Because I'm here now talking to you,

3334
03:14:23,589 --> 03:14:25,383
that in itself is,

3335
03:14:25,466 --> 03:14:28,678
you know, an attempt to...

3336
03:14:32,181 --> 03:14:35,434
But you don't feel anything at all?

3337
03:14:37,186 --> 03:14:38,271
No.

3338
03:14:40,731 --> 03:14:43,442
Water under the dam.

3339
03:14:46,988 --> 03:14:48,906
Any... Any remorse

3340
03:14:49,657 --> 03:14:51,117
for the families?

3341
03:14:51,200 --> 03:14:53,661
I... I didn't know the families.

3342
03:14:56,706 --> 03:14:58,916
I didn't know 'em. Except one I knew.

3343
03:15:04,505 --> 03:15:07,466
I think we can... we can be sorry...

3344
03:15:07,550 --> 03:15:11,053
We can be sorry
even when we don't feel sorry.

3345
03:15:11,137 --> 03:15:14,181
Well, for us to say,
to make a decision of the will...

3346
03:15:14,265 --> 03:15:15,266
"God...

3347
03:15:15,892 --> 03:15:17,560
I am sorry, God.

3348
03:15:19,395 --> 03:15:20,396
Forgive me."

3349
03:15:21,439 --> 03:15:24,317
And that... that's a decision of the will.

3350
03:15:30,990 --> 03:15:33,534
What kind of man...

3351
03:15:35,119 --> 03:15:37,872
makes a... a phone call like that?

3352
03:15:43,502 --> 03:15:45,755
What do you mean? What phone call?

3353
03:15:45,838 --> 03:15:48,215
Well, I can't tell you.

3354
03:15:50,384 --> 03:15:51,719
I can't. I got...

3355
03:15:52,887 --> 03:15:54,055
That's okay.

3356
03:15:57,600 --> 03:15:59,435
Frank, do you wanna pray with me again?

3357
03:15:59,518 --> 03:16:00,519
Yeah.

3358
03:16:01,354 --> 03:16:03,189
This time,
we'll do it in our own words. Okay?

3359
03:16:03,272 --> 03:16:04,357
Okay.

3360
03:16:06,567 --> 03:16:08,319
God, we come before you

3361
03:16:09,153 --> 03:16:11,405
sinful and sorrowful.

3362
03:16:11,489 --> 03:16:13,699
Sinful and sorrowful.

3363
03:16:15,076 --> 03:16:19,038
We know you are all good and all merciful.

3364
03:16:19,121 --> 03:16:22,416
We know you are all good and all merciful.

3365
03:16:23,751 --> 03:16:26,837
- We ask you...
- We ask you...

3366
03:16:26,921 --> 03:16:32,009
- to help us see ourselves...
- to help us see ourselves...

3367
03:16:32,093 --> 03:16:34,929
<i>- as you see us.
- As you see us.</i>

3368
03:16:37,890 --> 03:16:39,600
That's my daughter, Peggy.

3369
03:16:39,684 --> 03:16:41,185
- Is it?
- Yeah.

3370
03:16:41,268 --> 03:16:42,729
I don't think I've met her yet.

3371
03:16:42,812 --> 03:16:45,815
Well, she...
she ain't been around too much.

3372
03:16:45,898 --> 03:16:47,316
Is she your only child?

3373
03:16:47,400 --> 03:16:49,735
No, I got four daughters.

3374
03:16:49,819 --> 03:16:51,737
Over there. See?

3375
03:16:51,821 --> 03:16:52,863
Beautiful.

3376
03:16:53,406 --> 03:16:55,282
- Busy man.
- Yeah.

3377
03:16:57,076 --> 03:16:58,077
Yeah.

3378
03:16:59,078 --> 03:17:00,162
Who's that with her?

3379
03:17:01,914 --> 03:17:03,332
You don't know who that is?

3380
03:17:05,292 --> 03:17:06,585
No.

3381
03:17:07,420 --> 03:17:08,546
Jimmy Hoffa.

3382
03:17:10,631 --> 03:17:11,632
Yeah.

3383
03:17:11,716 --> 03:17:12,717
Yeah, right, "Yeah."

3384
03:17:14,927 --> 03:17:16,054
You don't know who he is.

3385
03:17:16,137 --> 03:17:17,888
Okay, I don't.

3386
03:17:18,681 --> 03:17:21,100
Yeah. Boy, you don't know how fast

3387
03:17:21,183 --> 03:17:23,561
time goes by until you get there.

3388
03:17:24,353 --> 03:17:26,147
But you don't have to worry about that

3389
03:17:26,230 --> 03:17:28,733
because you have
your whole life ahead of you.

3390
03:17:28,816 --> 03:17:31,152
- Forever. It goes fast, time —
-Hey.

3391
03:17:31,235 --> 03:17:32,737
I'm tellin' ya.

3392
03:17:32,820 --> 03:17:34,656
I'm trying to take your pulse,
Mr. Sheeran.

3393
03:17:34,739 --> 03:17:36,198
Please, please don't talk.

3394
03:17:38,284 --> 03:17:39,285
It's great today.

3395
03:17:39,785 --> 03:17:41,287
I'm still alive?

3396
03:17:41,370 --> 03:17:43,622
- Yes, you are.
- That's good to know.

3397
03:17:44,165 --> 03:17:45,499
Alive and well.

3398
03:17:45,583 --> 03:17:46,709
And you're free

3399
03:17:46,792 --> 03:17:49,504
till later today when we have
to put you through all this again.

3400
03:17:49,587 --> 03:17:50,588
I'm here.

3401
03:18:09,565 --> 03:18:11,025
Ministry of the church.

3402
03:18:11,108 --> 03:18:13,903
May God grant you pardon and peace, Frank.

3403
03:18:13,986 --> 03:18:15,613
And I absolve you from your sins.

3404
03:18:15,696 --> 03:18:18,115
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,

3405
03:18:18,199 --> 03:18:20,451
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

3406
03:18:21,410 --> 03:18:23,996
Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.

3407
03:18:24,080 --> 03:18:25,122
His mercy...

3408
03:18:25,206 --> 03:18:27,375
- His mercy endures forever.
- Endures forever.

3409
03:18:27,458 --> 03:18:30,753
All right, Frank.
I'll be back to visit, okay? Very soon.

3410
03:18:30,836 --> 03:18:33,255
Probably after the Christmas holidays.

3411
03:18:33,339 --> 03:18:34,882
Okay.

3412
03:18:34,965 --> 03:18:37,760
- Frank, God bless you.
- You too. Thank you.

3413
03:18:40,179 --> 03:18:41,180
It's Christmas?

3414
03:18:42,473 --> 03:18:43,474
Almost.

3415
03:18:44,517 --> 03:18:46,102
Well, I ain't going nowhere.

3416
03:18:48,687 --> 03:18:50,731
- Hey, Father?
- Yup?

3417
03:18:50,815 --> 03:18:53,192
Do me a favor?

3418
03:18:53,275 --> 03:18:56,195
Don't shut the door all the way.
I don't like that. Just...

3419
03:18:56,278 --> 03:18:58,489
- leave it open a little bit.
- Okay.
